The Seven Spiritual Laws of  Success form the essence of this teaching. When this\\nknowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited\\nwealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour.\\nSuccess in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-\\nsive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process\\nthat requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a\\nmore spiritual approach to success and to affluence, which is the abundant flow of all goodthings to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmonywith nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.\\nThere are many aspects to success; material wealth is only one component. Moreover,\\nsuccess is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be\\none of those things that makes the journey more enjoyable. But success also includes goodhealth, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional andpsychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.\\nEven with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the\\nseeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in\\nembryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the\\nexperience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception ofdivinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive \\x97 in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of aflower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expressionof divinity \\x97 not occasionally, but all the time \\x97 then we will know the true meaning of success.\\nBefore defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the\\nprocess by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; it\\x92s the process by which the observerbecomes the observed; it\\x92s the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; it\\x92s the processthrough which the dreamer manifests the dream.\\nAll of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest\\ntransforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our\\nphysical body, the physical universe \\x97 anything and everything that we can perceive throughour senses \\x97 is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,known, and visible.\\nThe physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience\\nItself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes\\nthrough which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself asthe objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.\\nThe source of all creation is divinity (or the spirit); the process of creation is divinity in\\nmotion (or the mind); and the object of creation is the physical universe (which includes the\\nphysical body).These three components of reality \\x97 spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of\\nobserving, and the observed \\x97 are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same\\nplace: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest.\\nThe physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or\\nconsciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anythingwe want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,or a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires.\\nNow let\\x92s go over The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  and see how we can apply them in\\nour lives.1\\nThe law of pure\\npotentialityThe source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from\\nthe unmanifest to the manifest.\\nAnd when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power\\nthat manifests everything in the universe.\\nIn the beginning there was neither existence\\nnor non-existence,\\nAll this world was unmanifest energy . . .\\nThe One breathed, without breath, by Its own\\npower Nothing else was there . . .\\n\\x97 Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda\\nThe first spiritual law of success is the Law of Pure Potentiality.  This law is based on\\nthe fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousnessis pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con-\\nsciousness is our spiritual essence. Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy. Other\\nattributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility,\\nsimplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality.\\nWhen you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in that knowing\\nitself is  the ability to fulfill any dream you have, because you are the eternal possibility, the\\nimmeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The Law of Pure Potentiality  could also be\\ncalled the Law of Unity,  because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all-\\npervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of purepotentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you areto the field of pure potentiality.\\nThe experience of the Self, or \\x93self-referral,\\x94 means that our internal reference point is our\\nown spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.\\nIn object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,\\ncircumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval ofothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is thereforefear-based.\\nIn object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for\\nexternal power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external\\npower are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,or the power of the Self, or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an\\nabsence of fear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or externalpower.\\nIn object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who\\nyou really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, becauseit lives in fear.\\nYour true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is ^completely free of those things. It is\\nimmune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is\\nalso humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the sameSelf, the same spirit in different disguises.The law of pure potentiality ¶7That\\x92s the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you\\nexperience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and\\nfeels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power.\\nPower based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts\\nonly as long as the object of reference is there. If you have a certain title \\x97 if you\\x92re thepresident of the country or the chairman of a corporation \\x97 or if you have a lot of money, thepower you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only\\nlast as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the\\npower.\\nSelf-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the\\nSelf. And there are certain characteristics of self-power.\\nIt draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people,\\nsituations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws\\nof nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state ofgrace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond withyou. Your power is that of bonding \\x97 a bonding that comes from true love.\\nHow can we apply the Law of Pure Potentiality, the field of all possibilities, to our lives? If\\nyou want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the\\ncreativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One wayto access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spendingtime in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,freedom, and bliss.\\nPracticing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply\\nBe. Experiencing silence means periodically withdrawing from the activity of speech. It also\\nmeans periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-dio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, thiscreates turbulence in your internal dialogue.\\nSet aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com-\\nmitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if\\nthat seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence foran extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week.\\nWhat happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue\\nbecomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. I\\x92ve known people who\\ngo absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of\\nsilence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with theexperience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.This is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around andaround if you \\x97 the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker \\x97 are not going to speak, period. Then,\\nas the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience the stillness of the field of pure\\npotentiality.\\nPracticing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the Law\\nof Pure Potentiality.  Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi-\\ntate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita-\\ntion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of\\npure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimateground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶8In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire,  you will see how you can intro-\\nduce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about\\nspontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for\\nmanifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentialitythat can orchestrate an infinity of details for you.\\nImagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while,\\nwhen the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. That\\x92s exactly what you\\ndo when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even\\nthe faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, whichconnects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-ness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,and you wouldn\\x92t notice a thing. In the Bible is the expression, \\x93Be still, and know that I am\\nGod.\\x94 This can only be accomplished through meditation.\\nAnother way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-\\nment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When youare constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in yourinternal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of\\npure potentiality. You literally squeeze the \\x93gap\\x94 between thoughts.\\nThe gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-\\nness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.And when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentialityand infinite creativity.\\nThere is a prayer in A Course in Miracles that states, \\x93Today I shall judge nothing that\\noccurs.\\x94 Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your\\nday with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each timeyou catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,then you may simply say to yourself, \\x93For the next two hours, I won\\x92t judge anything,\\x94 or \\x93Forthe next hour, I will experience non-judgment.\\x94 Then you can extend it gradually.\\nThrough silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first\\nlaw, the Law of Pure Potentiality.  Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component\\nto this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spendingtime in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces oflife, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,\\na lake, or the seashore, that connection with nature\\x92s intelligence will also help you access the\\nfield of pure potentiality.\\nYou must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence\\nis beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.\\nAccess to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-\\ncause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you haveguilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections ofguilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or successwill solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true\\nhealing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self \\x97 when you really\\nunderstand your true nature \\x97 you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, oraffluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realize that the essence of all materialwealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.9 The law of pure potentiality¶As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive\\ncreative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and\\npure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, \\x93You need not\\nleave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.You need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freelyoffer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.\\x94\\nThe affluence of the universe \\x97 the lavish display and abundance of the universe \\x97 is an\\nexpression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the\\nmore you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond theturbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creativemind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying thestillness of the eternal, unbounded, creative mind. This exquisite combination of silent, un-\\nbounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of\\nstillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence ofopposites \\x97 stillness and dynamism at the same time \\x97 makes you independent of situations,circumstances, people, and things.\\nWhen you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself\\nwith the world of energy \\x97 the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of\\nthe material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.And yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent.\\nStillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a\\ncertain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you tounleash your creativity in all directions \\x97 wherever the power of your attention takes you.\\nWherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you.\\nThen the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir ofcreativity, the field of pure potentiality.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITY\\nI will put the Law of Pure Potentiality  into effect by making a commitment to take the\\nfollowing steps:\\n(1) I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent,\\nto just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately\\nthirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.\\n(2) I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli-\\ngence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to thesound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy ofmy own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the\\nfield of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.\\n(3) I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, \\x93Today, I shall\\njudge nothing that occurs,\\x94 and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶102\\nThe Law of\\nGivingThe universe operates through dynamic ex-\\nchange... giving and receiving are different aspects\\nof the flow of energy in the universe.\\nAnd in our willingness to give that which we\\nseek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu-\\nlating in our lives.\\nThis frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,\\nand fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of areed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast\\nbreathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy\\ninfinite gifts come to me only on those very small\\nhands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest,\\nand still there is room to fill.\\n\\x97 Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali\\nThe second spiritual law of success is the Law of Giving. This law could also be called\\nthe Law of Giving and Receiving,  because the universe operates through dynamic\\nexchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with\\nthe body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; yourenergy is an expression of cosmic energy.\\nThe flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and\\nforces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces\\nin your life operates as the Law of Giving.  Because your body and your mind and the universe\\nare in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping theflow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That iswhy you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence \\x97 or anything you want inlife \\x97 circulating in your life.\\nThe word affluence comes from the root word \\x93affluere,\\x94 which means \\x93to flow to.\\x94 The\\nword affluence means \\x93to flow in abundance.\\x94 Money is really a symbol of the life energy weexchange and the life energy we use as a result of the service we provide to the universe.Another word for money is \\x93currency,\\x94 which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. Theword currency comes from the Latin word \\x93currere\\x94 which means \\x93to run\\x94 or to flow.\\nTherefore, if we stop the circulation of money \\x97 if our only intention is to hold on to our\\nmoney and hoard it \\x97 since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives aswell. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like ariver, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-gle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.\\nEvery relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en-\\ngenders giving. What goes up must come down; what goes out must come back. In reality,receiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of theflow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with nature\\x92sintelligence.\\nIn every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it\\nmust give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows intomaterial manifestation.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶12The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the\\nuniverse circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is\\ngiven. That which doesn\\x92t multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If,\\nthrough the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given andwill not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.\\nIt is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The\\nintention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is\\nlife-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro-\\nportional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of givinghas to be joyful \\x97 the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the very act of  giving.\\nThen the energy behind the giving increases many times over.\\nPracticing the Law of Giving  is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if\\nyou want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention\\nand appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. Infact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principleworks equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessedwith all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life.\\nEven the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer  has the power to\\naffect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle ofenergy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles ofconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word \\x93consciousness\\x94 implies more than just energyand information \\x97 it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore weare bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform.\\nLife is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of\\nimpulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and theuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind.\\nWhen you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with\\nan exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life.\\nThe best way to put the Law of Giving  into operation \\x97 to start the whole process of\\ncirculation \\x97 is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you willgive them something. It doesn\\x92t have to be in the form of material things; it could be a flower, acompliment, or a prayer. In fact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The giftsof caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you\\ncan give, and they don\\x92t cost you anything.\\nWhen you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness,\\njoy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful.\\nOne of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go\\nto anyone\\x92s house without bringing something \\x97 never visit anyone without bringing them a\\ngift. You may say, \\x93How can I give to others when at the moment I don\\x92t have enough myself?\\x94\\nYou can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something aboutyour feelings for the person you\\x92re visiting. You can bring a compliment. You can bring aprayer.\\nMake a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as you\\x92re giving,\\nyou will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous\\neffects of this law. And as you receive more, your ability to give more will also increase.\\nOur true nature is one of affluence and abundance; we are naturally affluent because nature\\nsupports every need and desire. We lack nothing, because our essential nature is one of pure13 The law of Giving¶potentiality and infinite possibilities. Therefore, you must know that you are already inherently\\naffluent, no matter how much or how little money you have, because the source of all wealth is\\nthe field of pure potentiality \\x97 it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need,\\nincluding joy, love, laughter, peace, harmony, and knowledge. If you seek these things first \\x97not only for yourself, but for others \\x97 all else will come to you spontaneously.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF GIVING\\nI will put the Law of  Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:\\n(1) Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift may be a\\ncompliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come intocontact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth and affluence inmy life and in the lives of others.\\n(2) Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts\\nof nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers or the first snow\\nof winter. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a\\nmaterial gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.\\n(3) I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving\\nlife\\x92s most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Eachtime I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶143\\nThe law\\nof \\x93karma\\x94\\nor cause\\nand effectEvery action generates a force of energy that\\nreturns to us in like kind . . . what we sow is what we\\nreap.\\nAnd when we choose actions that bring happi-\\nness and success to others, the fruit of our karma is\\nhappiness and success.\\nKarma is the eternal assertion of human free-\\ndom. . . . Our thoughts, our words, and deeds arethe threads of the net which we throw around our-\\nselves.\\n\\x97 Swami Vivekananda\\nThe third spiritual law of success is the Law of Karma.  \\x93Karma\\x94 is both action and the\\nconsequence of that action; it is cause and effect simultaneously, because every\\naction generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. There is nothing\\nunfamiliar about the Law of  Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, \\x93What you sow is what\\nyou reap.\\x94 Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow theseeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making.\\nYou and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are\\nin that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these\\nchoices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-stand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices wemake in every moment.\\nWhether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the\\nchoices you\\x92ve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and\\ntherefore we don\\x92t think they are choices \\x97 and yet, they are.\\nIf I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to\\npay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. Butthink about it: it\\x92s still a choice.\\nI could offend you and I could insult you, and you could make the choice of not being\\noffended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter\\nyou either.\\nIn other words, most of us \\x97 even though we are infinite choice-makers \\x97 have become\\nbundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstancesinto predictable outcomes of behaviour. These conditioned reflexes are like Pavlovian condi-\\ntioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time\\nyou ring a bell, soon the dog starts to salivate when you just ring the bell, because it hasassociated one stimulus with the other.\\nMost of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the\\nstimuli in our environment. Our reactions seem to be automatically triggered by people and\\ncircumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of\\nour existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously.\\nIf you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those\\nchoices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconsciousThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶16realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is\\nvery empowering.\\nWhen you make any choice \\x97 any choice at all \\x97 you can ask yourself two things: First of\\nall, \\x93What are the consequences of this choice that I\\x92m making?\\x94 In your heart you will immedi-ately know what these are. Secondly, \\x93Will this choice that I\\x92m making now bring happiness tome and to those around me?\\x94 If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answeris no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then don\\x92t make that\\nchoice. It\\x92s as simple as that.\\nThere is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will\\ncreate happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,it will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous rightaction is the right action at the right moment. It\\x92s the right response to every situation as it\\nhappens. It\\x92s the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.\\nThere is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane-\\nously correct choices. The mechanism has to do with sensations in your body. Your bodyexperiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation ofdiscomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask\\nyour body, \\x93If I make this choice, what happens?\\x94 If your body sends a message of comfort,\\nthat\\x92s the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then it\\x92s not the appropriatechoice.\\nFor some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus,\\nbut for most people it\\x92s in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart andask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response \\x97 a physical response in the form of a\\nsensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling \\x97 but it\\x92s there, in your body.\\nOnly the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti-\\nmental. But it\\x92s not. The heart is intuitive; it\\x92s holistic, it\\x92s contextual, it\\x92s relational. It doesn\\x92thave a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer \\x97 the field of pure potentiality,pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power \\x97 and takes everything into account. At times it\\nmay not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and\\nfar more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.\\nYou can use the Law of Karma  to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good\\nthings to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your futureis generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a\\nregular basis, then you are making full use of the Law of Karma.  The more you bring your\\nchoices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices whichare spontaneously correct \\x97 both for you and those around you.\\nWhat about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can\\ndo about past karma. One is to pay your karmic debts. Most people choose to do that \\x97\\nunconsciously, of course. This may be a choice you make, also. Sometimes there\\x92s a lot of\\nsuffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the Law of Karma  says no debt in the\\nuniverse ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everythingis a constant \\x93to and fro\\x94 exchange of energy.\\nThe second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable\\nexperience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as you\\x92re paying your\\nkarmic debt, \\x93What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is themessage that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellowhuman beings?\\x9417 The law of Carma or Cause and Effect¶By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity\\nwith your dharma,  with your purpose in life, which we\\x92ll talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law\\nof Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression.\\nFor example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, \\x93What can I learn\\nfrom this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me?\\x94 Perhaps the mes-sage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.And if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, \\x93How can I make this\\nexperience useful to my fellow human beings?\\x94 you may decide to share what you learned by\\nwriting a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support thatprevents the kind of injury you experienced.\\nThis way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a\\nbenefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into\\na positive experience. You haven\\x92t really gotten rid of your kar ma, but you are able to take a\\nkarmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.\\nThe third way to deal with karma is to transcend it. To transcend karma is to become\\nindependent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, theSpirit. It\\x92s like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you\\ntake away a few stains. You keep washing it again and again, and each time it gets a little\\ncleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming outagain. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.\\nAll actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action\\ngenerates memory, and memory has the ability or the potentiality to generate desire. Anddesire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and\\ndesire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire.\\nBy becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator ofreality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-tionary for you and for those that are around you. And that\\x92s all you need to do.\\nAs long as karma is evolutionary \\x97 for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self \\x97\\nthen the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF KARMA OR CAUSE AND EFFECT\\nI will put the Law of Karma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of\\nthese choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best\\nway to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.\\n(2) Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself two questions: \\x93What are the conse-\\nquences of this choice that I\\x92m making?\\x94 and \\x93Will this choice bring fulfillment andhappiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?\\x94\\n(3) I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or\\ndiscomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If thechoice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with\\nmy inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices\\nfor myself and for all those around me.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶184\\nThe law of least\\neffortNature 5 intelligence functions with effortless\\nease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.\\nAnd when we harness the forces of harmony,\\njoy, and love, we create success and good fortune\\nwith effortless ease.\\nAn integral being knows without going, sees\\nwithout looking, and accomplishes without doing.\\n\\x97 Lao T ZU\\nThe fourth spiritual law of success is the Law of Least Effort.  This law is based on the\\nfact that nature\\x92s intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned carefulness. This is the principle of least action, of no resistance. This is, therefore, the\\nprinciple of harmony and love. When we learn this lesson from nature, we easily fulfill ourdesires.\\nIf you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesn\\x92t try to\\ngrow, it just grows. Fish don\\x92t try to swim, they just swim. Flowers don\\x92t try to bloom, they\\nbloom. Birds don\\x92t try to fly, they fly. This is their intrinsic nture. The earth doesn\\x92t try to spinon its own axis; it is the nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle throughspace. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the natureof the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into\\nphysical form, easily and effortlessly.\\nIn Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of\\neconomy of effort, or \\x93do less and accomplish more.\\x94 Ultimately you come to the state whereyou do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and thenthe manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a \\x93miracle\\x94 isactually an expression of the Law of Least Effort.\\nNature\\x92s intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it\\nis intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you areestablished in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the Law of Least Effort.\\nLeast effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held\\ntogether by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you wasteenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing theillusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money forpersonal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expressionof nature\\x92s intelligence. But when your actions are motivated by love, there is no waste ofenergy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates \\x97and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,including unlimited wealth.\\nYou can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate,\\nstore, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-cient way, then you can create any amount of wealth. Attention to the ego consumes thegreatest amount of energy. When your internal reference point is the ego, when you seekpower and control over other people or seek approval from others, you spend energy in awasteful way.\\nWhen that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you\\nwant. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and\\nunfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the\\nexperience of affluence and evolution.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶20In The Art of Dreaming,  Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, \\x93. . . most of our energy goes\\ninto upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two\\nextraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main-\\ntain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energyto catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe.\\x94\\nThere are three components to the Law of Least Effort \\x97  three things you can do to put\\nthis principle of \\x93do less and accomplish more\\x94 into action. The first component is acceptance.Acceptance simply means that you make a commitment: \\x93Today I will accept people, situa-tions, circumstances, and events as they occur.\\x94 This means I will know that this moment is as\\nit should be,  because the whole universe is as it should be. This moment \\x97 the one you\\x92re\\nexperiencing right now \\x97 is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in thepast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is.\\nWhen you struggle against this moment, you\\x92re actually struggling against the entire uni-\\nverse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the wholeuniverse by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your acceptance  of this moment is\\ntotal and complete. You accept things as they are, not as you wish they were in this moment.\\nThis is important to understand. You can wish for things in the future to be different, but in this\\nmoment you have to accept things as they are.\\nWhen you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not\\nreacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.These are your feelings, and your feelings are not someone else\\x92s fault. When you recognize\\nand understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and tochange it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for yoursituation and for all the events you see as problems.\\nThis leads us to the second component of the Law of Least Effort:  responsibility. What\\ndoes responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-tion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-bility then means the ability  to have a creative response to the situation as it is now.  All prob-\\nlems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment andtransform it to a better situation or thing.\\nOnce you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the\\ncreation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will becomeyour teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, youwill have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve.\\nWhenever confronted by a tyrant, tormentor, teacher, friend, or foe (they all mean the\\nsame thing) remind yourself, \\x93This moment is as it should be.\\x94 Whatever relationships you haveattracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your ownevolution.\\nThe third component of the Law of Least Effort  is defencelessness, which means that your\\nawareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince orpersuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, you\\x92ll see that theyspend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish theneed to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormousamounts of energy that have been previously wasted.\\nWhen you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo-\\nment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you forcethe situation, the resistance will only increase. You don\\x92t want to stand rigid like a tall oak thatcracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends withthe storm and survives.\\nCompletely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point to defend,\\nyou do not allow the birth of an argument. If you do this consistently \\x97 if you stop fighting and21 The law of least effort\\n¶resisting \\x97 you will fully experience the present, which is a gift. Someone once told me, \\x93The\\npast is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That is why this moment is\\ncalled \\x91the present\\x92.\\x94\\nIf you embrace the present and become one with it, and merge with it, you will experience\\na fire, a glow, a sparkle of ecstasy throbbing in every living sentient being. As you begin toexperience this exultation of spirit in everything that is alive, as you become intimate with it, joywill be born within you, and you will drop the terrible burdens and encumbrances of defensive-\\nness, resentment, and hurtfulness. Only then will you become light-hearted, carefree, joyous,\\nand free.\\nIn this joyful, simple freedom, you will know without any doubt in your heart that what you\\nwant is available to you whenever you want it, because your want will be from the level ofhappiness, not from the level of anxiety or fear. You do not need to justify; simply declare your\\nintent to yourself, and you will experience fulfillment, delight, joy, freedom, and autonomy in\\nevery moment of your life.\\nMake a commitment to follow the path of no resistance. This is the path through which\\nnature\\x92s intelligence unfolds spontaneously, without friction or effort. When you have the exqui-site combination of acceptance, responsibility, and defenselessness, you will experience life\\nflowing with effortless ease.\\nWhen you remain open to all points of view \\x97 not rigidly attached to only one \\x97 your\\ndreams and desires will flow with nature\\x92s desires. Then you can release your intentions, with-out attachment, and just wait for the appropriate season for your desires to blossom into reality.You can be sure that when the season is right, your desires will manifest. This is the Law of\\nLeast Effort.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF LEAST EFFORT\\nI will put the Law of Least Effort  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) I will practice Acceptance.  Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and\\nevents as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be,  because the whole\\nuniverse is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling\\nagainst this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they arethis moment, not as I wish they were.\\n(2) Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility  for my situation and for\\nall those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaminganyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that everyproblem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to\\ntake this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.\\n(3) Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness.  I will relinquish the\\nneed to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others toaccept my point of view. I will remain open to all points of view and not be rigidlyattached to any one of them.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶225\\nTHE LAW  of\\nINTENTION  and\\nDESIREInherent in every intention and desire is the\\nmechanics for its fulfillment. . . intention and desire\\nin the field of pure potentiality have infinite organiz-ing power.\\nAnd when we introduce an intention in the fer-\\ntile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite\\norganiyng power to work for us.\\nIn the beginning there was desire, which was\\nthe first seed of mind; sages, having meditated in\\ntheir hearts, have discovered by their wisdom the\\nconnection of the existent with the non-existent.\\n\\x97 The Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda\\nThe fifth spiritual law of success is the Law of Intention and Desire.  This law is based\\non the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. In fact, at thelevel of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy and information. The\\nquantum field is just another label for the field of pure consciousness or pure potentiality. And\\nthis quantum field is influenced by intention and desire. Let\\x92s examine this process in detail.\\nA flower, a rainbow, a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their\\nessential components, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essential nature,is the movement  of energy and information. The only difference between you and a tree is the\\ninformational and energy content of your respective bodies.\\nOn the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the same recycled elements:\\nmostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements in minute amounts. You could\\nbuy these elements in a hardware store for a couple of dollars. The difference, therefore, be-tween you and the tree is not the carbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and thetree are constantly exchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real differencebetween the two of you is in the energy and in the information.\\nIn the scheme of nature, you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that\\nis capable of becoming aware of  the energy and informational content of that localized field that\\ngives rise to our physical body. We  experience  this field subjectively as our own thoughts,\\nfeelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, and beliefs. This same field is experi-enced objectively as the physical body \\x97 and through the physical body, we experience this\\nfield as the world. But it\\x92s all the same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, \\x93I am that,\\nyou are that, all this is that, and that\\x92s all there is.\\x94\\nYour body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantum mechanical\\nlevels there are no well-defined edges. You are like a wiggle, a wave, a fluctuation, a convolu-tion, a whirlpool, a localized disturbance in the larger quantum field. The larger quantum field\\n\\x97 the universe \\x97 is your extended body.\\nNot only is the human nervous system capable of becoming aware of the information and\\nenergy of its own quantum field, but because human consciousness is infinitely flexible throughthis wonderful nervous system, you are able to consciously change the informational contentthat gives rise to your physical body. You can consciously change the energy and informational\\ncontent or your own quantum mechanical body, and therefore influence the energy and infor-The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶24mational content of your extended body \\x97 your environment, your world \\x97 and cause things\\nto manifest in it.\\nThis conscious change is brought about by the two qualities inherent in consciousness:\\nattention and intention. Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put yourattention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from willwither, disintegrate, and disappear. Intention, on the other hand, triggers transformation ofenergy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment.\\nThe quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time\\nevents to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws ofsuccess. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.Infinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all atthe same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass,\\nin every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive.\\nIn the scheme of nature, everything correlates and connects with everything else. The\\ngroundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migratein a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony isbeing silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation.\\nThe human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human\\nbody is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell isdoing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,and monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlationis part of its information field.\\nWhat is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command\\nthis infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed\\nor locked into a rigid network of energy and information. It has infinite flexibility. In otherwords, as long as you do not violate the other laws of nature, through your intent you canliterally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires.\\nYou can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You\\ncan go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing\\nthe intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation.\\nIntention lays the groundwork for the effortless, spontaneous, frictionless flow of pure\\npotentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is thatyou use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in\\nalignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.\\nIntention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is\\ndesire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most peopleis attention with attachment. Intent is desire with strict adherence to all the other laws, butparticularly the Law of Detachment,  which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success.\\nIntention combined with detachment leads to life-centered, present-moment awareness.\\nAnd when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Y our intent  is\\nfor the future, but your attention  is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present,\\nthen your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. Youmust accept the present as is. Accept the present and intend the future. The future is something\\nyou can always create through detached intention, but you should never struggle against the\\npresent.25 The law of Intention and Desire¶The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection,\\nmemory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement\\nof thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is aware-\\nness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is aneternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat,electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. Theyjust are.\\nOur interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena\\nand form. Remembered interpretations of abstract forces create the experience of the past,anticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualitiesof attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, thenaction in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future.\\nIntention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the\\nright mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire.\\nIf you have life-centered, present-moment awareness, then the imaginary obstacles \\x97\\nwhich are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles \\x97 disintegrate and disappear. Theremaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through\\none-pointed intention.\\nOne-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose.\\nOne-pointed intention means holding your attention to the intended outcome with such un-bending purpose that you absolutely refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate thefocused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles fromyour consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to\\nyour goal with intense passion. This is the power of detached awareness and one-pointed,\\nfocused intention simultaneously.\\nLearn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can\\nstill get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,and the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow-\\ning five steps in the Law of  Intention and Desire.  When you follow these five steps for fulfilling\\nyour desires, intention generates its own power:\\n(1) Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts,\\nto go into the silence \\x97 that level of Being which is your essential state.\\n(2) Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are\\nactually in the gap, there\\x92s no thought, there\\x92s no intention, but as you come out of the\\ngap \\x97 at that junction between the gap and a thought \\x97 you introduce the intention.If you have a series of goals, you can write them down, and have your intentionfocused on them before you go into the gap. If you want a successful career, forexample, you go into the gap with that intention, and the intention will already be\\nthere as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the\\ngap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting themto bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desiresto see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.You simply want to release them.\\n(3) Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of\\nyour true Self \\x97 your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It alsoThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶26means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourself to be\\ninfluenced by the opinions and criticisms of others. A helpful way to maintain that\\nstate of self-referral is to keep your desires to yourself; do not share them with anyone\\nelse unless they share the exact same desires that you have and are closely bondedwith you.\\n(4) Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. This means giving up your rigid attach-\\nment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. It means enjoyingevery moment in the journey of your life, even if you don\\x92t know the outcome.\\n(5) Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions and desires, when released in the\\ngap, have infinite organizing power. Trust that infinite organizing power of intention\\nto orchestrate all the details for you.\\nRemember that your true nature is one of pure spirit. Carry the consciousness of your spirit\\nwherever you go, gently release your desires, and the universe will handle the details for you.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIRE\\nI will put the Law of Intention and Desire  into effect by making a commitment to take the\\nfollowing steps:\\n(1) I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me wherever I go. I will look\\nat this list before I go into my silence and meditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep\\nat night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning.\\n(2) I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting\\nthat when things don\\x92t seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic planhas designs for me much grander than even those that I have conceived.\\n(3) I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will\\nrefuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in thepresent moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my\\ndeepest, most cherished intentions and desires.27 The law of Intention and Desire¶6\\nTHE LAW  of\\nDETACHMENTIn detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty,\\nin the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from\\nour past, from the known, which is the prison ofpast conditioning.\\nAnd in our willingness to step into the unknown,\\nthe field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to\\nthe creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the\\nuniverse.\\nLike two golden birds perched on the selfsame\\ntree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell in\\nthe same body. The former eats the sweet and sour\\nfruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in\\ndetachment.\\n\\x97 The Mundaka Upanishad\\nThe sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment.  The Law of Detachment\\nsays that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquishyour attachment to it. This doesn\\x92t mean you give up the intention to create your\\ndesire. You don\\x92t give up the intention, and you don\\x92t give up the desire. You give up your\\nattachment to the result.\\nThis a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result,\\ncombining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that whichyou desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment isbased on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self.\\nAttachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity \\x97 and the need for security\\nis based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in thephysical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everythingelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they comeand go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it\\nends up making you feel hollow and empty inside, because you exchange your Self for the\\nsymbols of your Self.\\nAttachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols.\\nDetachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-dom to create. Only from detached involvement can one have joy and laughter. Then the\\nsymbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris-\\noners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, andseriousness \\x97 the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-ness.\\nTrue wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and\\nwith least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of\\nuncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want.\\nPeople are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a\\nvery ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, \\x93WhenI have X million dollars, then I\\x92ll be secure. Then I\\x92ll be financially independent and I will retire.\\nThen I will do all the things I really want to do.\\x94 But it never happens \\x97 never  happens.29 The law of pure Detachment¶Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and\\nephemeral, because security can never come from money alone. Attachment to money will\\nalways create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the\\npeople who have the most money are the most insecure.\\nThe search for security is an illusion. In ancient wisdom traditions, the solution to this\\nwhole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means thatthe search for security and certainty is actually an attachment  to the known. And what\\x92s the\\nknown? The known is our past. The known is nothing other than the prison of past con-\\nditioning. There\\x92s no evolution in that \\x97 absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,there is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.\\nUncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer-\\ntainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the\\nfield of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations.\\nWithout uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. Youbecome the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday.\\nRelinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the\\nfield of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom\\nof uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite-\\nment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life \\x97 the magic, the celebration, theexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.\\nEvery day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities.\\nWhen you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path \\x97 so don\\x92t give it up. You don\\x92tneed to have a complete and rigid idea of what you\\x92ll be doing next week or next year, because\\nif you have a very clear idea of what\\x92s going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then\\nyou shut out a whole range of possibilities.\\nOne characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches-\\ntrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when youare attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea-\\ntivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire\\nfrom that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the wholeprocess of creation.\\nThe Law of Detachment  does not interfere with the Law of  Intention and Desire \\x97  with\\ngoal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal.\\nHowever, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored\\nin, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find somethingmore exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stayalert to opportunities.\\nThe Law of Detachment  accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand\\nthis law, you don\\x92t feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems,\\nyou only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and youwitness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaosand the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting.\\nThis state of alertness \\x97 your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty \\x97\\nmeets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity. What\\x92s the\\nopportunity? It\\x92s contained within every problem that you have in your life. Every single prob-lem that you have in your life is the seed of an opportunity for some greater benefit. Once youThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶30have that perception, you open up to a whole range of possibilities \\x97 and this keeps the\\nmystery, the wonder, the excitement, the adventure alive.\\nYou can look at every problem you have in your life as an opportunity for some greater\\nbenefit. You can stay alert to opportunities by being grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty.When your preparedness meets opportunity, the solution will spontaneously appear.\\nWhat comes out of that is often called \\x93good luck.\\x94 Good luck is nothing but preparedness\\nand opportunity coming together. When the two are mixed together with an alert witnessing of\\nthe chaos, a solution emerges that will be of evolutionary benefit to you and to all those that you\\ncome into contact with. This is the perfect recipe for success, and it is based on the Law of\\nDetachment.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF DETACHMENT\\nI will put the Law of Detachment  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) Today I will commit myself to detachment. 1 will allow myself and those around me the\\nfreedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I\\nwill not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participatein everything with detached involvement.\\n(2) Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my\\nwillingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the prob-lem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be,the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the\\nwisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security.\\n(3) I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur\\nwhen I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibili-ties, I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life.31 The law of Detachment¶7\\nThe law of\\n\\x93dharma\\x94 or\\npurpose in lifeEveryone has a purpose in life ... a unique gift\\nor special talent to give to others.\\nAnd when we blend this unique talent with ser-\\nvice to others, we experience the ecstasy and exulta-\\ntion of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of\\nall goals.\\nWhen you work you are a flute through whose\\nheart the whispering of the hours turns to music.And what is it to work with love\\n. It is to weave the\\ncloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if\\nyour beloved were to wear that cloth. . . .\\n\\x97 Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet\\nThe seventh spiritual law of success is the Law of Dharma.  Dharma is a Sanskrit word\\nthat means \\x93purpose in life.\\x94 The Law of Dharma  says that we have taken manifes\\ntation in physical form to fulfill a purpose. The field of pure potentiality is divinity in\\nits essence, and the divine takes human form to fulfill a purpose.\\nAccording to this law, you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. There is\\nsomething that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world \\x97 and for every uniquetalent and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs arematched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence.Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.\\nIf you could start children right from the beginning with this thought, you\\x92d see the effect it\\nhas on their lives. In fact, I did this with my own children. Again and again, I told them there was\\na reason why they were here, and they had to find out what that reason was for themselves.From the age of four years, they heard  this. I also taught them to meditate when they were\\nabout the same age, and I told them, \\x93I never, ever want you to worry about making a living. Ifyou\\x92re unable to make a living when you grow up, I\\x92ll provide for you, so don\\x92t worry about that.\\nI don\\x92t want you to focus on doing well in school. I don\\x92t want you to focus on getting the best\\ngrades or going to the best colleges. What I really want you to focus on is asking yourself howyou can serve humanity, and asking yourself what your unique talents are. Because you have aunique talent that no one else has, and you have a special way of expressing that talent, and noone else has it.\\x94 They ended up going to the best schools, getting the best grades, and even in\\ncollege, they are unique in that they are financially self-sufficient, because they are focused on\\nwhat they are here to give.  This then, is the Law of Dharma.\\nThere are three components to the Law of Dharma.  The first component says that each of\\nus is here to discover our true Self, to find out on our own that our true Self is spiritual, thatessentially we are spiritual beings that have taken manifestation in physical form. We\\x92re not\\nhuman beings that have occasional spiritual experiences \\x97 it\\x92s the other way around: we\\x92re\\nspiritual beings that have occasional human experiences.\\nEach of us is here to discover our higher self or our spiritual self. That\\x92s the first fulfillment\\nof the Law of Dharma.  We must find out for ourself that inside us is a god or goddess in embryo\\nthat wants to be born so that we can express our divinity.\\nThe second component of the Law of Dharma  is to express our unique talents. The Law of\\nDharma says that every human being has a unique talent. You have a talent that is unique in its33 The law of Dharme or purpose in life¶expression, so unique that there\\x92s no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that\\nexpression of that talent. This means that there\\x92s one thing you can do, and one way of doing\\nit, that is better than anyone else on this entire planet. When you\\x92re doing that one thing, you\\nlose track of time. When you\\x92re expressing that one unique talent that you possess \\x97 or morethan one unique talent in many cases \\x97 the expression of that talent takes you into timelessawareness.\\nThe third component of the Law of Dharma  is service to humanity \\x97 to serve your fellow\\nhuman beings and to ask yourself the questions, \\x93How can I help? How can I help all those that\\nI come into contact with?\\x94 When you combine the ability to express your unique talent withservice to humanity, then you make full use of the Law of Dharma.  And coupled with the\\nexperience of your own spirituality, the field of pure potentiality, there is no way you will not\\nhave access to unlimited abundance, because that is the real way abundance is achieved.\\nThis is not a temporary abundance; it\\x92s permanent, because of your unique talent, your\\nway of expressing it, and your service and dedication to your fellow human beings, which youdiscover through asking the question, \\x93How can I help?\\x94 instead of \\x93What\\x92s in it for me?\\x94\\nThe question, \\x93What\\x92s in it for me?\\x94 is the internal dialogue of the ego. Asking \\x93How can\\nI help?\\x94 is the internal dialogue of the spirit. The spirit is that domain of your awareness where\\nyou experience your universality. In just shifting your internal dialogue from \\x93What\\x92s in it for\\nme?\\x94 to \\x93How can I help?\\x94 you automatically go beyond the ego into the domain of your spirit.While meditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simply shifting yourinternal dialogue to \\x93How can I help?\\x94 will also access the spirit, that domain of your awarenesswhere you experience your universality.\\nIf you want to make maximum use of the Law of Dharma,  then you have to make several\\ncommitments.\\nThe first commitment is: I am going to seek my higher self, which is beyond my ego,\\nthrough spiritual practice.\\nThe second commitment is: I am going to discover my unique talents, and finding my\\nunique talents, I am going to enjoy myself, because the process of enjoyment occurs when I go\\ninto timeless awareness. That\\x92s when I am in a state of bliss.\\nThe third commitment is: I am going to ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity.\\nI am going to answer that question and then put it into practice. I am going to use my uniquetalents to serve the needs of my fellow human beings \\x97 I will match those needs to my desire tohelp and serve others.\\nSit down and make a list of the answers to these two questions: Ask yourself, if money was\\nno concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do? If you wouldstill do what you currently do, then you are in dharma, because you have passion  for what you\\ndo \\x97 you are expressing your unique talents. Then ask yourself: How am I best suited to servehumanity? Answer that question, and put it into practice.\\nDiscover your divinity, find your unique talent, serve humanity with it, and you can gener-\\nate all the wealth that you want. When your creative expressions match the needs of your fellowhumans, then wealth will spontaneously flow from the unmanifest into the manifest, from therealm of the spirit to the world of form. You will begin to experience your life as a miraculousexpression of divinity \\x97 not just occasionally, but all the time. And you will know true joy and\\nthe true meaning of success \\x97 the ecstasy and exultation of your own spirit.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶34APPLYING THE LAW OF \\x93DHARMA\\x94 OR PURPOSE IN LIFE\\nI will put the Law ofDharma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) Today I will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryo that lies deep within my\\nsoul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animates both my body and mymind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the con-\\nsciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience.\\n(2) I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while\\nexpressing my unique talents. When 1 express my unique talents and use them in the\\nservice of humanity, I lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as inthe lives of others.\\n(3) I will ask myself daily, \\x93How can I serve?\\x94 and \\x93How can I help?\\x94 The answers to these\\nquestions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love.\\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\\nI want to know God\\x92s thoughts...\\nthe rest are details.\\n\\x97 Albert Einstein\\nThe universal mind choreographs everything that is happening in billions of galaxies with\\nelegant precision and unfaltering intelligence. Its intelligence is ultimate and supreme, and itpermeates every fiber of existence: from the smallest to the largest, from the atom to the\\ncosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper-\\nates through The Seven Spiritual Laws.\\nIf you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres-\\nsion of these laws. Every cell, whether it\\x92s a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has itsbirth in the Law of Pure Potentiality.  DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is\\nthe material expression  of pure potentiality. The same DNA existing in every cell expresses\\nitself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell.\\nEach cell also operates through the Law of Giving. A cell is alive and healthy when it is in\\na state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,but it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell,\\nand in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the\\nflow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only bymaintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence.\\nThe Law of Karma  is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is\\nthe most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs.\\nThe Law of Least Effort  is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job\\nwith quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.35 The law of purpose ¶Through the Law of Intention and Desire,  every intention of every cell harnesses the infi-\\nnite organizing power of nature\\x92s intelligence. Even a simple intention such as metabolizing a\\nmolecule of sugar immediately sets off a symphony of events in the body where precise amounts\\nof hormones have to be secreted at precise moments to convert this molecule of sugar into purecreative energy.\\nOf course, every cell expresses the Law of Detachment.  It is detached from the outcome of\\nits intentions. It doesn\\x92t stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered,\\npresent-moment awareness.\\nEach cell also expresses the Law of Dharma.  Each cell must discover its own source, the\\nhigher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomachcells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. Andbecause they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents\\nwith effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they\\nmaintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body. The internal dialogue ofevery cell in the human body is, \\x93How can I help?\\x94 The heart cells want to help the immunecells, the immune cells want to help the stomach and lung cells, and the brain cells are listeningto and helping every other cell. Every cell in the human body has only one function: to help\\nevery other cell.\\nBy looking at the behaviour of the cells of our own body, we can observe the most extraor-\\ndinary and efficient expression of The Seven Spiritual Laws. This is the genius of nature\\x92sintelligence. These are the thoughts of God \\x97 the rest are details.\\nThe Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  are powerful principles that will enable you to attain\\nself-mastery. If you put your attention on these laws and practice the steps outlined in this book,\\nyou will see that you can manifest anything you want \\x97 all the affluence, money, and success\\nthat you desire. You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,for these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.\\nThere is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help\\nyou to remember them. The Law of Pure Potentiality  is experienced through silence, through\\nmeditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the\\nLaw of  Giving. The principle here is to learn to give that which you seek. That\\x92s how you\\nactivate the Law of Pure Potentiality. If you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money,\\ngive money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,and affection.\\nThrough your actions in the Law of  Giving you activate the Law of Karma.  You create\\ngood karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you don\\x92t have toexpend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of theLaw of Least Effort.  When everything is easy and effortless, and your desires keep getting\\nfulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the Law of Intention and Desire.  Fulfilling your\\ndesires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the Law of Detachment.\\nFinally, as you begin to understand all the above laws, you begin to focus on your true\\npurpose in life, which leads to the Law of Dharma.  Through the use of this law, by expressing\\nyour unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whateveryou want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an\\nexpression of unbounded love.\\nWe are travellers on a cosmic journey \\x97 star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and\\nwhirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. But the expressions of life are ephemeral, momentary,The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶36transient. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, This existence of ours is as\\ntransient as autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at the  move-\\nments of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of  lightning in the sky, Rushing by like a torrent down\\na steep  mountain.\\nWe have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is\\na precious moment, but it is transient. It is a little parenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring,lightheart-edness, and love, we will create abundance and joy for each other. And then this\\nmoment will have been worthwhile.\\n* * *37 The law of purpose ¶Deepak Chopra is a world-renowned leader in the field of mind-body medicine and human\\npotential.

The Seven Spiritual Laws of  Success form the essence of this teaching. When this\\nknowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited\\nwealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour.\\nSuccess in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-\\nsive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process\\nthat requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a\\nmore spiritual approach to success and to affluence, which is the abundant flow of all goodthings to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmonywith nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.\\nThere are many aspects to success; material wealth is only one component. Moreover,\\nsuccess is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be\\none of those things that makes the journey more enjoyable. But success also includes goodhealth, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional andpsychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.\\nEven with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the\\nseeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in\\nembryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the\\nexperience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception ofdivinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive \\x97 in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of aflower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expressionof divinity \\x97 not occasionally, but all the time \\x97 then we will know the true meaning of success.\\nBefore defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the\\nprocess by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; it\\x92s the process by which the observerbecomes the observed; it\\x92s the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; it\\x92s the processthrough which the dreamer manifests the dream.\\nAll of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest\\ntransforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our\\nphysical body, the physical universe \\x97 anything and everything that we can perceive throughour senses \\x97 is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,known, and visible.\\nThe physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience\\nItself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes\\nthrough which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself asthe objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.\\nThe source of all creation is divinity (or the spirit); the process of creation is divinity in\\nmotion (or the mind); and the object of creation is the physical universe (which includes the\\nphysical body).These three components of reality \\x97 spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of\\nobserving, and the observed \\x97 are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same\\nplace: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest.\\nThe physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or\\nconsciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anythingwe want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,or a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires.\\nNow let\\x92s go over The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  and see how we can apply them in\\nour lives.1\\nThe law of pure\\npotentialityThe source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from\\nthe unmanifest to the manifest.\\nAnd when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power\\nthat manifests everything in the universe.\\nIn the beginning there was neither existence\\nnor non-existence,\\nAll this world was unmanifest energy . . .\\nThe One breathed, without breath, by Its own\\npower Nothing else was there . . .\\n\\x97 Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda\\nThe first spiritual law of success is the Law of Pure Potentiality.  This law is based on\\nthe fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousnessis pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con-\\nsciousness is our spiritual essence. Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy. Other\\nattributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility,\\nsimplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality.\\nWhen you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in that knowing\\nitself is  the ability to fulfill any dream you have, because you are the eternal possibility, the\\nimmeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The Law of Pure Potentiality  could also be\\ncalled the Law of Unity,  because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all-\\npervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of purepotentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you areto the field of pure potentiality.\\nThe experience of the Self, or \\x93self-referral,\\x94 means that our internal reference point is our\\nown spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.\\nIn object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,\\ncircumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval ofothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is thereforefear-based.\\nIn object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for\\nexternal power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external\\npower are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,or the power of the Self, or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an\\nabsence of fear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or externalpower.\\nIn object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who\\nyou really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, becauseit lives in fear.\\nYour true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is ^completely free of those things. It is\\nimmune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is\\nalso humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the sameSelf, the same spirit in different disguises.The law of pure potentiality ¶7That\\x92s the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you\\nexperience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and\\nfeels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power.\\nPower based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts\\nonly as long as the object of reference is there. If you have a certain title \\x97 if you\\x92re thepresident of the country or the chairman of a corporation \\x97 or if you have a lot of money, thepower you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only\\nlast as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the\\npower.\\nSelf-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the\\nSelf. And there are certain characteristics of self-power.\\nIt draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people,\\nsituations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws\\nof nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state ofgrace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond withyou. Your power is that of bonding \\x97 a bonding that comes from true love.\\nHow can we apply the Law of Pure Potentiality, the field of all possibilities, to our lives? If\\nyou want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the\\ncreativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One wayto access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spendingtime in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,freedom, and bliss.\\nPracticing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply\\nBe. Experiencing silence means periodically withdrawing from the activity of speech. It also\\nmeans periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-dio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, thiscreates turbulence in your internal dialogue.\\nSet aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com-\\nmitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if\\nthat seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence foran extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week.\\nWhat happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue\\nbecomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. I\\x92ve known people who\\ngo absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of\\nsilence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with theexperience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.This is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around andaround if you \\x97 the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker \\x97 are not going to speak, period. Then,\\nas the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience the stillness of the field of pure\\npotentiality.\\nPracticing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the Law\\nof Pure Potentiality.  Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi-\\ntate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita-\\ntion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of\\npure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimateground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶8In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire,  you will see how you can intro-\\nduce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about\\nspontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for\\nmanifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentialitythat can orchestrate an infinity of details for you.\\nImagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while,\\nwhen the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. That\\x92s exactly what you\\ndo when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even\\nthe faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, whichconnects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-ness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,and you wouldn\\x92t notice a thing. In the Bible is the expression, \\x93Be still, and know that I am\\nGod.\\x94 This can only be accomplished through meditation.\\nAnother way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-\\nment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When youare constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in yourinternal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of\\npure potentiality. You literally squeeze the \\x93gap\\x94 between thoughts.\\nThe gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-\\nness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.And when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentialityand infinite creativity.\\nThere is a prayer in A Course in Miracles that states, \\x93Today I shall judge nothing that\\noccurs.\\x94 Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your\\nday with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each timeyou catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,then you may simply say to yourself, \\x93For the next two hours, I won\\x92t judge anything,\\x94 or \\x93Forthe next hour, I will experience non-judgment.\\x94 Then you can extend it gradually.\\nThrough silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first\\nlaw, the Law of Pure Potentiality.  Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component\\nto this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spendingtime in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces oflife, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,\\na lake, or the seashore, that connection with nature\\x92s intelligence will also help you access the\\nfield of pure potentiality.\\nYou must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence\\nis beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.\\nAccess to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-\\ncause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you haveguilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections ofguilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or successwill solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true\\nhealing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self \\x97 when you really\\nunderstand your true nature \\x97 you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, oraffluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realize that the essence of all materialwealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.9 The law of pure potentiality¶As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive\\ncreative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and\\npure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, \\x93You need not\\nleave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.You need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freelyoffer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.\\x94\\nThe affluence of the universe \\x97 the lavish display and abundance of the universe \\x97 is an\\nexpression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the\\nmore you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond theturbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creativemind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying thestillness of the eternal, unbounded, creative mind. This exquisite combination of silent, un-\\nbounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of\\nstillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence ofopposites \\x97 stillness and dynamism at the same time \\x97 makes you independent of situations,circumstances, people, and things.\\nWhen you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself\\nwith the world of energy \\x97 the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of\\nthe material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.And yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent.\\nStillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a\\ncertain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you tounleash your creativity in all directions \\x97 wherever the power of your attention takes you.\\nWherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you.\\nThen the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir ofcreativity, the field of pure potentiality.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITY\\nI will put the Law of Pure Potentiality  into effect by making a commitment to take the\\nfollowing steps:\\n(1) I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent,\\nto just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately\\nthirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.\\n(2) I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli-\\ngence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to thesound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy ofmy own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the\\nfield of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.\\n(3) I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, \\x93Today, I shall\\njudge nothing that occurs,\\x94 and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶102\\nThe Law of\\nGivingThe universe operates through dynamic ex-\\nchange... giving and receiving are different aspects\\nof the flow of energy in the universe.\\nAnd in our willingness to give that which we\\nseek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu-\\nlating in our lives.\\nThis frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,\\nand fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of areed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast\\nbreathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy\\ninfinite gifts come to me only on those very small\\nhands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest,\\nand still there is room to fill.\\n\\x97 Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali\\nThe second spiritual law of success is the Law of Giving. This law could also be called\\nthe Law of Giving and Receiving,  because the universe operates through dynamic\\nexchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with\\nthe body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; yourenergy is an expression of cosmic energy.\\nThe flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and\\nforces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces\\nin your life operates as the Law of Giving.  Because your body and your mind and the universe\\nare in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping theflow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That iswhy you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence \\x97 or anything you want inlife \\x97 circulating in your life.\\nThe word affluence comes from the root word \\x93affluere,\\x94 which means \\x93to flow to.\\x94 The\\nword affluence means \\x93to flow in abundance.\\x94 Money is really a symbol of the life energy weexchange and the life energy we use as a result of the service we provide to the universe.Another word for money is \\x93currency,\\x94 which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. Theword currency comes from the Latin word \\x93currere\\x94 which means \\x93to run\\x94 or to flow.\\nTherefore, if we stop the circulation of money \\x97 if our only intention is to hold on to our\\nmoney and hoard it \\x97 since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives aswell. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like ariver, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-gle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.\\nEvery relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en-\\ngenders giving. What goes up must come down; what goes out must come back. In reality,receiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of theflow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with nature\\x92sintelligence.\\nIn every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it\\nmust give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows intomaterial manifestation.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶12The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the\\nuniverse circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is\\ngiven. That which doesn\\x92t multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If,\\nthrough the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given andwill not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.\\nIt is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The\\nintention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is\\nlife-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro-\\nportional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of givinghas to be joyful \\x97 the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the very act of  giving.\\nThen the energy behind the giving increases many times over.\\nPracticing the Law of Giving  is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if\\nyou want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention\\nand appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. Infact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principleworks equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessedwith all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life.\\nEven the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer  has the power to\\naffect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle ofenergy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles ofconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word \\x93consciousness\\x94 implies more than just energyand information \\x97 it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore weare bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform.\\nLife is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of\\nimpulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and theuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind.\\nWhen you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with\\nan exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life.\\nThe best way to put the Law of Giving  into operation \\x97 to start the whole process of\\ncirculation \\x97 is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you willgive them something. It doesn\\x92t have to be in the form of material things; it could be a flower, acompliment, or a prayer. In fact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The giftsof caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you\\ncan give, and they don\\x92t cost you anything.\\nWhen you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness,\\njoy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful.\\nOne of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go\\nto anyone\\x92s house without bringing something \\x97 never visit anyone without bringing them a\\ngift. You may say, \\x93How can I give to others when at the moment I don\\x92t have enough myself?\\x94\\nYou can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something aboutyour feelings for the person you\\x92re visiting. You can bring a compliment. You can bring aprayer.\\nMake a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as you\\x92re giving,\\nyou will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous\\neffects of this law. And as you receive more, your ability to give more will also increase.\\nOur true nature is one of affluence and abundance; we are naturally affluent because nature\\nsupports every need and desire. We lack nothing, because our essential nature is one of pure13 The law of Giving¶potentiality and infinite possibilities. Therefore, you must know that you are already inherently\\naffluent, no matter how much or how little money you have, because the source of all wealth is\\nthe field of pure potentiality \\x97 it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need,\\nincluding joy, love, laughter, peace, harmony, and knowledge. If you seek these things first \\x97not only for yourself, but for others \\x97 all else will come to you spontaneously.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF GIVING\\nI will put the Law of  Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:\\n(1) Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift may be a\\ncompliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come intocontact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth and affluence inmy life and in the lives of others.\\n(2) Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts\\nof nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers or the first snow\\nof winter. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a\\nmaterial gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.\\n(3) I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving\\nlife\\x92s most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love.

Our thoughts, our words, and deeds arethe threads of the net which we throw around our-\\nselves.\\n\\x97 Swami Vivekananda\\nThe third spiritual law of success is the Law of Karma.  \\x93Karma\\x94 is both action and the\\nconsequence of that action; it is cause and effect simultaneously, because every\\naction generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. There is nothing\\nunfamiliar about the Law of  Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, \\x93What you sow is what\\nyou reap.\\x94 Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow theseeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making.\\nYou and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are\\nin that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these\\nchoices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-stand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices wemake in every moment.\\nWhether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the\\nchoices you\\x92ve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and\\ntherefore we don\\x92t think they are choices \\x97 and yet, they are.\\nIf I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to\\npay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. Butthink about it: it\\x92s still a choice.\\nI could offend you and I could insult you, and you could make the choice of not being\\noffended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter\\nyou either.\\nIn other words, most of us \\x97 even though we are infinite choice-makers \\x97 have become\\nbundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstancesinto predictable outcomes of behaviour. These conditioned reflexes are like Pavlovian condi-\\ntioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time\\nyou ring a bell, soon the dog starts to salivate when you just ring the bell, because it hasassociated one stimulus with the other.\\nMost of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the\\nstimuli in our environment. Our reactions seem to be automatically triggered by people and\\ncircumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of\\nour existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously.\\nIf you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those\\nchoices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconsciousThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶16realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is\\nvery empowering.\\nWhen you make any choice \\x97 any choice at all \\x97 you can ask yourself two things: First of\\nall, \\x93What are the consequences of this choice that I\\x92m making?\\x94 In your heart you will immedi-ately know what these are. Secondly, \\x93Will this choice that I\\x92m making now bring happiness tome and to those around me?\\x94 If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answeris no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then don\\x92t make that\\nchoice. It\\x92s as simple as that.\\nThere is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will\\ncreate happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,it will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous rightaction is the right action at the right moment. It\\x92s the right response to every situation as it\\nhappens. It\\x92s the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.\\nThere is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane-\\nously correct choices. The mechanism has to do with sensations in your body. Your bodyexperiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation ofdiscomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask\\nyour body, \\x93If I make this choice, what happens?\\x94 If your body sends a message of comfort,\\nthat\\x92s the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then it\\x92s not the appropriatechoice.\\nFor some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus,\\nbut for most people it\\x92s in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart andask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response \\x97 a physical response in the form of a\\nsensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling \\x97 but it\\x92s there, in your body.\\nOnly the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti-\\nmental. But it\\x92s not. The heart is intuitive; it\\x92s holistic, it\\x92s contextual, it\\x92s relational. It doesn\\x92thave a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer \\x97 the field of pure potentiality,pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power \\x97 and takes everything into account. At times it\\nmay not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and\\nfar more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.\\nYou can use the Law of Karma  to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good\\nthings to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your futureis generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a\\nregular basis, then you are making full use of the Law of Karma.  The more you bring your\\nchoices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices whichare spontaneously correct \\x97 both for you and those around you.\\nWhat about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can\\ndo about past karma. One is to pay your karmic debts. Most people choose to do that \\x97\\nunconsciously, of course. This may be a choice you make, also. Sometimes there\\x92s a lot of\\nsuffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the Law of Karma  says no debt in the\\nuniverse ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everythingis a constant \\x93to and fro\\x94 exchange of energy.\\nThe second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable\\nexperience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as you\\x92re paying your\\nkarmic debt, \\x93What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is themessage that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellowhuman beings?\\x9417 The law of Carma or Cause and Effect¶By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity\\nwith your dharma,  with your purpose in life, which we\\x92ll talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law\\nof Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression.\\nFor example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, \\x93What can I learn\\nfrom this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me?\\x94 Perhaps the mes-sage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.And if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, \\x93How can I make this\\nexperience useful to my fellow human beings?\\x94 you may decide to share what you learned by\\nwriting a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support thatprevents the kind of injury you experienced.\\nThis way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a\\nbenefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into\\na positive experience. You haven\\x92t really gotten rid of your kar ma, but you are able to take a\\nkarmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.\\nThe third way to deal with karma is to transcend it. To transcend karma is to become\\nindependent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, theSpirit. It\\x92s like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you\\ntake away a few stains. You keep washing it again and again, and each time it gets a little\\ncleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming outagain. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.\\nAll actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action\\ngenerates memory, and memory has the ability or the potentiality to generate desire. Anddesire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and\\ndesire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire.\\nBy becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator ofreality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-tionary for you and for those that are around you. And that\\x92s all you need to do.\\nAs long as karma is evolutionary \\x97 for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self \\x97\\nthen the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF KARMA OR CAUSE AND EFFECT\\nI will put the Law of Karma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of\\nthese choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best\\nway to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.\\n(2) Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself two questions: \\x93What are the conse-\\nquences of this choice that I\\x92m making?\\x94 and \\x93Will this choice bring fulfillment andhappiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?\\x94\\n(3) I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or\\ndiscomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If thechoice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with\\nmy inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices\\nfor myself and for all those around me.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶184\\nThe law of least\\neffortNature 5 intelligence functions with effortless\\nease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.\\nAnd when we harness the forces of harmony,\\njoy, and love, we create success and good fortune\\nwith effortless ease.\\nAn integral being knows without going, sees\\nwithout looking, and accomplishes without doing.\\n\\x97 Lao T ZU\\nThe fourth spiritual law of success is the Law of Least Effort.  This law is based on the\\nfact that nature\\x92s intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned carefulness. This is the principle of least action, of no resistance. This is, therefore, the\\nprinciple of harmony and love. When we learn this lesson from nature, we easily fulfill ourdesires.\\nIf you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesn\\x92t try to\\ngrow, it just grows. Fish don\\x92t try to swim, they just swim. Flowers don\\x92t try to bloom, they\\nbloom. Birds don\\x92t try to fly, they fly. This is their intrinsic nture. The earth doesn\\x92t try to spinon its own axis; it is the nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle throughspace. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the natureof the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into\\nphysical form, easily and effortlessly.\\nIn Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of\\neconomy of effort, or \\x93do less and accomplish more.\\x94 Ultimately you come to the state whereyou do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and thenthe manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a \\x93miracle\\x94 isactually an expression of the Law of Least Effort.\\nNature\\x92s intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it\\nis intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you areestablished in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the Law of Least Effort.\\nLeast effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held\\ntogether by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you wasteenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing theillusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money forpersonal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expressionof nature\\x92s intelligence. But when your actions are motivated by love, there is no waste ofenergy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates \\x97and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,including unlimited wealth.\\nYou can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate,\\nstore, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-cient way, then you can create any amount of wealth. Attention to the ego consumes thegreatest amount of energy. When your internal reference point is the ego, when you seekpower and control over other people or seek approval from others, you spend energy in awasteful way.\\nWhen that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you\\nwant. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and\\nunfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the\\nexperience of affluence and evolution.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶20In The Art of Dreaming,  Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, \\x93. . . most of our energy goes\\ninto upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two\\nextraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main-\\ntain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energyto catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe.\\x94\\nThere are three components to the Law of Least Effort \\x97  three things you can do to put\\nthis principle of \\x93do less and accomplish more\\x94 into action. The first component is acceptance.Acceptance simply means that you make a commitment: \\x93Today I will accept people, situa-tions, circumstances, and events as they occur.\\x94 This means I will know that this moment is as\\nit should be,  because the whole universe is as it should be. This moment \\x97 the one you\\x92re\\nexperiencing right now \\x97 is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in thepast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is.\\nWhen you struggle against this moment, you\\x92re actually struggling against the entire uni-\\nverse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the wholeuniverse by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your acceptance  of this moment is\\ntotal and complete. You accept things as they are, not as you wish they were in this moment.\\nThis is important to understand. You can wish for things in the future to be different, but in this\\nmoment you have to accept things as they are.\\nWhen you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not\\nreacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.These are your feelings, and your feelings are not someone else\\x92s fault. When you recognize\\nand understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and tochange it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for yoursituation and for all the events you see as problems.\\nThis leads us to the second component of the Law of Least Effort:  responsibility. What\\ndoes responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-tion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-bility then means the ability  to have a creative response to the situation as it is now.  All prob-\\nlems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment andtransform it to a better situation or thing.\\nOnce you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the\\ncreation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will becomeyour teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, youwill have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve.\\nWhenever confronted by a tyrant, tormentor, teacher, friend, or foe (they all mean the\\nsame thing) remind yourself, \\x93This moment is as it should be.\\x94 Whatever relationships you haveattracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your ownevolution.\\nThe third component of the Law of Least Effort  is defencelessness, which means that your\\nawareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince orpersuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, you\\x92ll see that theyspend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish theneed to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormousamounts of energy that have been previously wasted.\\nWhen you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo-\\nment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you forcethe situation, the resistance will only increase. You don\\x92t want to stand rigid like a tall oak thatcracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends withthe storm and survives.\\nCompletely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point to defend,\\nyou do not allow the birth of an argument. If you do this consistently \\x97 if you stop fighting and21 The law of least effort\\n¶resisting \\x97 you will fully experience the present, which is a gift. Someone once told me, \\x93The\\npast is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That is why this moment is\\ncalled \\x91the present\\x92.\\x94\\nIf you embrace the present and become one with it, and merge with it, you will experience\\na fire, a glow, a sparkle of ecstasy throbbing in every living sentient being. As you begin toexperience this exultation of spirit in everything that is alive, as you become intimate with it, joywill be born within you, and you will drop the terrible burdens and encumbrances of defensive-\\nness, resentment, and hurtfulness. Only then will you become light-hearted, carefree, joyous,\\nand free.\\nIn this joyful, simple freedom, you will know without any doubt in your heart that what you\\nwant is available to you whenever you want it, because your want will be from the level ofhappiness, not from the level of anxiety or fear. You do not need to justify; simply declare your\\nintent to yourself, and you will experience fulfillment, delight, joy, freedom, and autonomy in\\nevery moment of your life.\\nMake a commitment to follow the path of no resistance. This is the path through which\\nnature\\x92s intelligence unfolds spontaneously, without friction or effort. When you have the exqui-site combination of acceptance, responsibility, and defenselessness, you will experience life\\nflowing with effortless ease.\\nWhen you remain open to all points of view \\x97 not rigidly attached to only one \\x97 your\\ndreams and desires will flow with nature\\x92s desires. Then you can release your intentions, with-out attachment, and just wait for the appropriate season for your desires to blossom into reality.You can be sure that when the season is right, your desires will manifest. This is the Law of\\nLeast Effort.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF LEAST EFFORT\\nI will put the Law of Least Effort  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) I will practice Acceptance.  Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and\\nevents as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be,  because the whole\\nuniverse is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling\\nagainst this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they arethis moment, not as I wish they were.\\n(2) Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility  for my situation and for\\nall those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaminganyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that everyproblem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to\\ntake this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.\\n(3) Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness.  I will relinquish the\\nneed to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others toaccept my point of view. I will remain open to all points of view and not be rigidlyattached to any one of them.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶225\\nTHE LAW  of\\nINTENTION  and\\nDESIREInherent in every intention and desire is the\\nmechanics for its fulfillment. . . intention and desire\\nin the field of pure potentiality have infinite organiz-ing power.\\nAnd when we introduce an intention in the fer-\\ntile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite\\norganiyng power to work for us.\\nIn the beginning there was desire, which was\\nthe first seed of mind; sages, having meditated in\\ntheir hearts, have discovered by their wisdom the\\nconnection of the existent with the non-existent.\\n\\x97 The Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda\\nThe fifth spiritual law of success is the Law of Intention and Desire.  This law is based\\non the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. In fact, at thelevel of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy and information. The\\nquantum field is just another label for the field of pure consciousness or pure potentiality. And\\nthis quantum field is influenced by intention and desire. Let\\x92s examine this process in detail.\\nA flower, a rainbow, a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their\\nessential components, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essential nature,is the movement  of energy and information. The only difference between you and a tree is the\\ninformational and energy content of your respective bodies.\\nOn the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the same recycled elements:\\nmostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements in minute amounts. You could\\nbuy these elements in a hardware store for a couple of dollars. The difference, therefore, be-tween you and the tree is not the carbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and thetree are constantly exchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real differencebetween the two of you is in the energy and in the information.\\nIn the scheme of nature, you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that\\nis capable of becoming aware of  the energy and informational content of that localized field that\\ngives rise to our physical body. We  experience  this field subjectively as our own thoughts,\\nfeelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, and beliefs. This same field is experi-enced objectively as the physical body \\x97 and through the physical body, we experience this\\nfield as the world. But it\\x92s all the same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, \\x93I am that,\\nyou are that, all this is that, and that\\x92s all there is.\\x94\\nYour body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantum mechanical\\nlevels there are no well-defined edges. You are like a wiggle, a wave, a fluctuation, a convolu-tion, a whirlpool, a localized disturbance in the larger quantum field. The larger quantum field\\n\\x97 the universe \\x97 is your extended body.\\nNot only is the human nervous system capable of becoming aware of the information and\\nenergy of its own quantum field, but because human consciousness is infinitely flexible throughthis wonderful nervous system, you are able to consciously change the informational contentthat gives rise to your physical body. You can consciously change the energy and informational\\ncontent or your own quantum mechanical body, and therefore influence the energy and infor-The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶24mational content of your extended body \\x97 your environment, your world \\x97 and cause things\\nto manifest in it.\\nThis conscious change is brought about by the two qualities inherent in consciousness:\\nattention and intention. Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put yourattention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from willwither, disintegrate, and disappear. Intention, on the other hand, triggers transformation ofenergy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment.\\nThe quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time\\nevents to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws ofsuccess. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.Infinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all atthe same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass,\\nin every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive.\\nIn the scheme of nature, everything correlates and connects with everything else. The\\ngroundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migratein a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony isbeing silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation.\\nThe human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human\\nbody is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell isdoing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,and monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlationis part of its information field.\\nWhat is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command\\nthis infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed\\nor locked into a rigid network of energy and information. It has infinite flexibility. In otherwords, as long as you do not violate the other laws of nature, through your intent you canliterally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires.\\nYou can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You\\ncan go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing\\nthe intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation.\\nIntention lays the groundwork for the effortless, spontaneous, frictionless flow of pure\\npotentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is thatyou use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in\\nalignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.\\nIntention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is\\ndesire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most peopleis attention with attachment. Intent is desire with strict adherence to all the other laws, butparticularly the Law of Detachment,  which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success.\\nIntention combined with detachment leads to life-centered, present-moment awareness.\\nAnd when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Y our intent  is\\nfor the future, but your attention  is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present,\\nthen your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. Youmust accept the present as is. Accept the present and intend the future. The future is something\\nyou can always create through detached intention, but you should never struggle against the\\npresent.25 The law of Intention and Desire¶The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection,\\nmemory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement\\nof thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is aware-\\nness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is aneternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat,electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. Theyjust are.\\nOur interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena\\nand form. Remembered interpretations of abstract forces create the experience of the past,anticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualitiesof attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, thenaction in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future.\\nIntention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the\\nright mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire.\\nIf you have life-centered, present-moment awareness, then the imaginary obstacles \\x97\\nwhich are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles \\x97 disintegrate and disappear. Theremaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through\\none-pointed intention.\\nOne-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose.\\nOne-pointed intention means holding your attention to the intended outcome with such un-bending purpose that you absolutely refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate thefocused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles fromyour consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to\\nyour goal with intense passion. This is the power of detached awareness and one-pointed,\\nfocused intention simultaneously.\\nLearn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can\\nstill get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,and the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow-\\ning five steps in the Law of  Intention and Desire.  When you follow these five steps for fulfilling\\nyour desires, intention generates its own power:\\n(1) Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts,\\nto go into the silence \\x97 that level of Being which is your essential state.\\n(2) Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are\\nactually in the gap, there\\x92s no thought, there\\x92s no intention, but as you come out of the\\ngap \\x97 at that junction between the gap and a thought \\x97 you introduce the intention.If you have a series of goals, you can write them down, and have your intentionfocused on them before you go into the gap. If you want a successful career, forexample, you go into the gap with that intention, and the intention will already be\\nthere as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the\\ngap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting themto bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desiresto see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.You simply want to release them.\\n(3) Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of\\nyour true Self \\x97 your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It alsoThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶26means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourself to be\\ninfluenced by the opinions and criticisms of others. A helpful way to maintain that\\nstate of self-referral is to keep your desires to yourself; do not share them with anyone\\nelse unless they share the exact same desires that you have and are closely bondedwith you.\\n(4) Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. This means giving up your rigid attach-\\nment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. It means enjoyingevery moment in the journey of your life, even if you don\\x92t know the outcome.\\n(5) Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions and desires, when released in the\\ngap, have infinite organizing power. Trust that infinite organizing power of intention\\nto orchestrate all the details for you.\\nRemember that your true nature is one of pure spirit. Carry the consciousness of your spirit\\nwherever you go, gently release your desires, and the universe will handle the details for you.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIRE\\nI will put the Law of Intention and Desire  into effect by making a commitment to take the\\nfollowing steps:\\n(1) I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me wherever I go. I will look\\nat this list before I go into my silence and meditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep\\nat night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning.\\n(2) I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting\\nthat when things don\\x92t seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic planhas designs for me much grander than even those that I have conceived.\\n(3) I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will\\nrefuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in thepresent moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my\\ndeepest, most cherished intentions and desires.27 The law of Intention and Desire¶6\\nTHE LAW  of\\nDETACHMENTIn detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty,\\nin the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from\\nour past, from the known, which is the prison ofpast conditioning.\\nAnd in our willingness to step into the unknown,\\nthe field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to\\nthe creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the\\nuniverse.\\nLike two golden birds perched on the selfsame\\ntree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell in\\nthe same body. The former eats the sweet and sour\\nfruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in\\ndetachment.\\n\\x97 The Mundaka Upanishad\\nThe sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment.  The Law of Detachment\\nsays that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquishyour attachment to it. This doesn\\x92t mean you give up the intention to create your\\ndesire. You don\\x92t give up the intention, and you don\\x92t give up the desire. You give up your\\nattachment to the result.\\nThis a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result,\\ncombining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that whichyou desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment isbased on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self.\\nAttachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity \\x97 and the need for security\\nis based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in thephysical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everythingelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they comeand go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it\\nends up making you feel hollow and empty inside, because you exchange your Self for the\\nsymbols of your Self.\\nAttachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols.\\nDetachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-dom to create. Only from detached involvement can one have joy and laughter. Then the\\nsymbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris-\\noners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, andseriousness \\x97 the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-ness.\\nTrue wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and\\nwith least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of\\nuncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want.\\nPeople are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a\\nvery ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, \\x93WhenI have X million dollars, then I\\x92ll be secure. Then I\\x92ll be financially independent and I will retire.\\nThen I will do all the things I really want to do.\\x94 But it never happens \\x97 never  happens.29 The law of pure Detachment¶Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and\\nephemeral, because security can never come from money alone. Attachment to money will\\nalways create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the\\npeople who have the most money are the most insecure.\\nThe search for security is an illusion. In ancient wisdom traditions, the solution to this\\nwhole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means thatthe search for security and certainty is actually an attachment  to the known. And what\\x92s the\\nknown? The known is our past. The known is nothing other than the prison of past con-\\nditioning. There\\x92s no evolution in that \\x97 absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,there is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.\\nUncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer-\\ntainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the\\nfield of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations.\\nWithout uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. Youbecome the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday.\\nRelinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the\\nfield of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom\\nof uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite-\\nment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life \\x97 the magic, the celebration, theexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.\\nEvery day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities.\\nWhen you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path \\x97 so don\\x92t give it up. You don\\x92tneed to have a complete and rigid idea of what you\\x92ll be doing next week or next year, because\\nif you have a very clear idea of what\\x92s going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then\\nyou shut out a whole range of possibilities.\\nOne characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches-\\ntrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when youare attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea-\\ntivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire\\nfrom that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the wholeprocess of creation.\\nThe Law of Detachment  does not interfere with the Law of  Intention and Desire \\x97  with\\ngoal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal.\\nHowever, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored\\nin, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find somethingmore exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stayalert to opportunities.\\nThe Law of Detachment  accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand\\nthis law, you don\\x92t feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems,\\nyou only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and youwitness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaosand the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting.\\nThis state of alertness \\x97 your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty \\x97\\nmeets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity. What\\x92s the\\nopportunity? It\\x92s contained within every problem that you have in your life. Every single prob-lem that you have in your life is the seed of an opportunity for some greater benefit. Once youThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶30have that perception, you open up to a whole range of possibilities \\x97 and this keeps the\\nmystery, the wonder, the excitement, the adventure alive.\\nYou can look at every problem you have in your life as an opportunity for some greater\\nbenefit. You can stay alert to opportunities by being grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty.When your preparedness meets opportunity, the solution will spontaneously appear.\\nWhat comes out of that is often called \\x93good luck.\\x94 Good luck is nothing but preparedness\\nand opportunity coming together. When the two are mixed together with an alert witnessing of\\nthe chaos, a solution emerges that will be of evolutionary benefit to you and to all those that you\\ncome into contact with. This is the perfect recipe for success, and it is based on the Law of\\nDetachment.\\nAPPLYING THE LAW OF DETACHMENT\\nI will put the Law of Detachment  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) Today I will commit myself to detachment. 1 will allow myself and those around me the\\nfreedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I\\nwill not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participatein everything with detached involvement.\\n(2) Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my\\nwillingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the prob-lem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be,the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the\\nwisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security.\\n(3) I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur\\nwhen I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibili-ties, I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life.31 The law of Detachment¶7\\nThe law of\\n\\x93dharma\\x94 or\\npurpose in lifeEveryone has a purpose in life ... a unique gift\\nor special talent to give to others.\\nAnd when we blend this unique talent with ser-\\nvice to others, we experience the ecstasy and exulta-\\ntion of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of\\nall goals.\\nWhen you work you are a flute through whose\\nheart the whispering of the hours turns to music.And what is it to work with love\\n. It is to weave the\\ncloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if\\nyour beloved were to wear that cloth. . . .\\n\\x97 Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet\\nThe seventh spiritual law of success is the Law of Dharma.  Dharma is a Sanskrit word\\nthat means \\x93purpose in life.\\x94 The Law of Dharma  says that we have taken manifes\\ntation in physical form to fulfill a purpose. The field of pure potentiality is divinity in\\nits essence, and the divine takes human form to fulfill a purpose.\\nAccording to this law, you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. There is\\nsomething that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world \\x97 and for every uniquetalent and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs arematched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence.Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.\\nIf you could start children right from the beginning with this thought, you\\x92d see the effect it\\nhas on their lives. In fact, I did this with my own children. Again and again, I told them there was\\na reason why they were here, and they had to find out what that reason was for themselves.From the age of four years, they heard  this. I also taught them to meditate when they were\\nabout the same age, and I told them, \\x93I never, ever want you to worry about making a living. Ifyou\\x92re unable to make a living when you grow up, I\\x92ll provide for you, so don\\x92t worry about that.\\nI don\\x92t want you to focus on doing well in school. I don\\x92t want you to focus on getting the best\\ngrades or going to the best colleges. What I really want you to focus on is asking yourself howyou can serve humanity, and asking yourself what your unique talents are. Because you have aunique talent that no one else has, and you have a special way of expressing that talent, and noone else has it.\\x94 They ended up going to the best schools, getting the best grades, and even in\\ncollege, they are unique in that they are financially self-sufficient, because they are focused on\\nwhat they are here to give.  This then, is the Law of Dharma.\\nThere are three components to the Law of Dharma.  The first component says that each of\\nus is here to discover our true Self, to find out on our own that our true Self is spiritual, thatessentially we are spiritual beings that have taken manifestation in physical form. We\\x92re not\\nhuman beings that have occasional spiritual experiences \\x97 it\\x92s the other way around: we\\x92re\\nspiritual beings that have occasional human experiences.\\nEach of us is here to discover our higher self or our spiritual self. That\\x92s the first fulfillment\\nof the Law of Dharma.  We must find out for ourself that inside us is a god or goddess in embryo\\nthat wants to be born so that we can express our divinity.\\nThe second component of the Law of Dharma  is to express our unique talents. The Law of\\nDharma says that every human being has a unique talent. You have a talent that is unique in its33 The law of Dharme or purpose in life¶expression, so unique that there\\x92s no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that\\nexpression of that talent. This means that there\\x92s one thing you can do, and one way of doing\\nit, that is better than anyone else on this entire planet. When you\\x92re doing that one thing, you\\nlose track of time. When you\\x92re expressing that one unique talent that you possess \\x97 or morethan one unique talent in many cases \\x97 the expression of that talent takes you into timelessawareness.\\nThe third component of the Law of Dharma  is service to humanity \\x97 to serve your fellow\\nhuman beings and to ask yourself the questions, \\x93How can I help? How can I help all those that\\nI come into contact with?\\x94 When you combine the ability to express your unique talent withservice to humanity, then you make full use of the Law of Dharma.  And coupled with the\\nexperience of your own spirituality, the field of pure potentiality, there is no way you will not\\nhave access to unlimited abundance, because that is the real way abundance is achieved.\\nThis is not a temporary abundance; it\\x92s permanent, because of your unique talent, your\\nway of expressing it, and your service and dedication to your fellow human beings, which youdiscover through asking the question, \\x93How can I help?\\x94 instead of \\x93What\\x92s in it for me?\\x94\\nThe question, \\x93What\\x92s in it for me?\\x94 is the internal dialogue of the ego. Asking \\x93How can\\nI help?\\x94 is the internal dialogue of the spirit. The spirit is that domain of your awareness where\\nyou experience your universality. In just shifting your internal dialogue from \\x93What\\x92s in it for\\nme?\\x94 to \\x93How can I help?\\x94 you automatically go beyond the ego into the domain of your spirit.While meditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simply shifting yourinternal dialogue to \\x93How can I help?\\x94 will also access the spirit, that domain of your awarenesswhere you experience your universality.\\nIf you want to make maximum use of the Law of Dharma,  then you have to make several\\ncommitments.\\nThe first commitment is: I am going to seek my higher self, which is beyond my ego,\\nthrough spiritual practice.\\nThe second commitment is: I am going to discover my unique talents, and finding my\\nunique talents, I am going to enjoy myself, because the process of enjoyment occurs when I go\\ninto timeless awareness. That\\x92s when I am in a state of bliss.\\nThe third commitment is: I am going to ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity.\\nI am going to answer that question and then put it into practice. I am going to use my uniquetalents to serve the needs of my fellow human beings \\x97 I will match those needs to my desire tohelp and serve others.\\nSit down and make a list of the answers to these two questions: Ask yourself, if money was\\nno concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do? If you wouldstill do what you currently do, then you are in dharma, because you have passion  for what you\\ndo \\x97 you are expressing your unique talents. Then ask yourself: How am I best suited to servehumanity? Answer that question, and put it into practice.\\nDiscover your divinity, find your unique talent, serve humanity with it, and you can gener-\\nate all the wealth that you want. When your creative expressions match the needs of your fellowhumans, then wealth will spontaneously flow from the unmanifest into the manifest, from therealm of the spirit to the world of form. You will begin to experience your life as a miraculousexpression of divinity \\x97 not just occasionally, but all the time. And you will know true joy and\\nthe true meaning of success \\x97 the ecstasy and exultation of your own spirit.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶34APPLYING THE LAW OF \\x93DHARMA\\x94 OR PURPOSE IN LIFE\\nI will put the Law ofDharma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following\\nsteps:\\n(1) Today I will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryo that lies deep within my\\nsoul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animates both my body and mymind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the con-\\nsciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience.\\n(2) I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while\\nexpressing my unique talents. When 1 express my unique talents and use them in the\\nservice of humanity, I lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as inthe lives of others.\\n(3) I will ask myself daily, \\x93How can I serve?\\x94 and \\x93How can I help?\\x94 The answers to these\\nquestions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love.\\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\\nI want to know God\\x92s thoughts...\\nthe rest are details.\\n\\x97 Albert Einstein\\nThe universal mind choreographs everything that is happening in billions of galaxies with\\nelegant precision and unfaltering intelligence. Its intelligence is ultimate and supreme, and itpermeates every fiber of existence: from the smallest to the largest, from the atom to the\\ncosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper-\\nates through The Seven Spiritual Laws.\\nIf you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres-\\nsion of these laws. Every cell, whether it\\x92s a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has itsbirth in the Law of Pure Potentiality.  DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is\\nthe material expression  of pure potentiality. The same DNA existing in every cell expresses\\nitself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell.\\nEach cell also operates through the Law of Giving. A cell is alive and healthy when it is in\\na state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,but it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell,\\nand in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the\\nflow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only bymaintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence.\\nThe Law of Karma  is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is\\nthe most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs.\\nThe Law of Least Effort  is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job\\nwith quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.35 The law of purpose ¶Through the Law of Intention and Desire,  every intention of every cell harnesses the infi-\\nnite organizing power of nature\\x92s intelligence. Even a simple intention such as metabolizing a\\nmolecule of sugar immediately sets off a symphony of events in the body where precise amounts\\nof hormones have to be secreted at precise moments to convert this molecule of sugar into purecreative energy.\\nOf course, every cell expresses the Law of Detachment.  It is detached from the outcome of\\nits intentions. It doesn\\x92t stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered,\\npresent-moment awareness.\\nEach cell also expresses the Law of Dharma.  Each cell must discover its own source, the\\nhigher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomachcells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. Andbecause they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents\\nwith effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they\\nmaintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body. The internal dialogue ofevery cell in the human body is, \\x93How can I help?\\x94 The heart cells want to help the immunecells, the immune cells want to help the stomach and lung cells, and the brain cells are listeningto and helping every other cell. Every cell in the human body has only one function: to help\\nevery other cell.\\nBy looking at the behaviour of the cells of our own body, we can observe the most extraor-\\ndinary and efficient expression of The Seven Spiritual Laws. This is the genius of nature\\x92sintelligence. These are the thoughts of God \\x97 the rest are details.\\nThe Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  are powerful principles that will enable you to attain\\nself-mastery. If you put your attention on these laws and practice the steps outlined in this book,\\nyou will see that you can manifest anything you want \\x97 all the affluence, money, and success\\nthat you desire. You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,for these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.\\nThere is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help\\nyou to remember them. The Law of Pure Potentiality  is experienced through silence, through\\nmeditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the\\nLaw of  Giving. The principle here is to learn to give that which you seek. That\\x92s how you\\nactivate the Law of Pure Potentiality. If you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money,\\ngive money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,and affection.\\nThrough your actions in the Law of  Giving you activate the Law of Karma.  You create\\ngood karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you don\\x92t have toexpend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of theLaw of Least Effort.  When everything is easy and effortless, and your desires keep getting\\nfulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the Law of Intention and Desire.  Fulfilling your\\ndesires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the Law of Detachment.\\nFinally, as you begin to understand all the above laws, you begin to focus on your true\\npurpose in life, which leads to the Law of Dharma.  Through the use of this law, by expressing\\nyour unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whateveryou want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an\\nexpression of unbounded love.\\nWe are travellers on a cosmic journey \\x97 star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and\\nwhirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. But the expressions of life are ephemeral, momentary,The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶36transient. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, This existence of ours is as\\ntransient as autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at the  move-\\nments of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of  lightning in the sky, Rushing by like a torrent down\\na steep  mountain.\\nWe have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is\\na precious moment, but it is transient. It is a little parenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring,lightheart-edness, and love, we will create abundance and joy for each other. And then this\\nmoment will have been worthwhile.\\n* * *37 The law of purpose ¶Deepak Chopra is a world-renowned leader in the field of mind-body medicine and human\\npotential.

       " Document(page_content='Rules for Migrating TypeEngine classes to 0.6\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. the TypeEngine classes are used for:\\n\\n    a. Specifying behavior which needs to occur for bind parameters\\n    or result row columns.\\n\\n    b. Specifying types that are entirely specific to the database\\n    in use and have no analogue in the sqlalchemy.types package.\\n\\n    c. Specifying types where there is an analogue in sqlalchemy.types,\\n    but the database in use takes vendor-specific flags for those\\n    types.\\n\\n    d. If a TypeEngine class doesn\\'t provide any of this, it should be\\n    *removed* from the dialect.\\n\\n2. the TypeEngine classes are *no longer* used for generating DDL.  Dialects\\nnow have a TypeCompiler subclass which uses the same visit_XXX model as\\nother compilers.\\n\\n3. the \"ischema_names\" and \"colspecs\" dictionaries are now required members on\\nthe Dialect class.\\n\\n4. The names of types within dialects are now important.   If a dialect-specific type\\nis a subclass of an existing generic type and is only provided for bind/result behavior, \\nthe current mixed case naming can remain, i.e. _PGNumeric for Numeric - in this case, \\nend users would never need to use _PGNumeric directly.   However, if a dialect-specific \\ntype is specifying a type *or* arguments that are not present generically, it should\\nmatch the real name of the type on that backend, in uppercase.

It\\'s named _SLDateTime and \\nsubclasses types.DateTime.\\n\\nExample 2.  MS-SQL has a TIME type which takes a non-standard \"precision\" argument\\nthat is rendered within DDL.   So it\\'s named TIME in the MS-SQL dialect\\'s base.py, \\nand subclasses types.TIME.  Users can then say mssql.TIME(precision=10).\\n\\nExample 3.  MS-SQL dialects also need special bind/result processing for date \\nBut its DATE type doesn\\'t render DDL differently than that of a plain \\nDATE, i.e. it takes no special arguments.  Therefore we are just adding behavior\\nto types.Date, so it\\'s named _MSDate in the MS-SQL dialect\\'s base.py, and subclasses\\ntypes.Date.\\n\\nExample 4.  MySQL has a SET type, there\\'s no analogue for this in types.py. So\\nMySQL names it SET in the dialect\\'s base.py, and it subclasses types.String, since \\nit ultimately deals with strings.\\n\\nExample 5.  PostgreSQL has a DATETIME type.  The DBAPIs handle dates correctly,\\nand no special arguments are used in PG\\'s DDL beyond what types.py provides.\\nPostgreSQL dialect therefore imports types.DATETIME into its base.py.\\n\\nIdeally one should be able to specify a schema using names imported completely from a \\ndialect, all matching the real name on that backend:\\n\\n   from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import base as pg\\n\\n   t = Table(\\'mytable\\', metadata,\\n              Column(\\'id\\', pg.INTEGER, primary_key=True),\\n              Column(\\'name\\', pg.VARCHAR(300)),\\n              Column(\\'inetaddr\\', pg.INET)\\n   )\\n\\nwhere above, the INTEGER and VARCHAR types are ultimately from sqlalchemy.types, \\nbut the PG dialect makes them available in its own namespace.\\n\\n5. \"colspecs\" now is a dictionary of generic or uppercased types from sqlalchemy.types\\nlinked to types specified in the dialect.   Again, if a type in the dialect does not\\nspecify any special behavior for bind_processor() or result_processor() and does not\\nindicate a special type only available in this database, it must be *removed* from the \\nmodule and from this dictionary.\\n\\n6. \"ischema_names\" indicates string descriptions of types as returned from the database\\nlinked to TypeEngine classes.\\n\\n    a. The string name should be matched to the most specific type possible within\\n    sqlalchemy.types, unless there is no matching type within sqlalchemy.types in which\\n    case it points to a dialect type.   *It doesn\\'t matter* if the dialect has its \\n    own subclass of that type with special bind/result behavior - reflect to the types.py\\n    UPPERCASE type as much as possible.   With very few exceptions, all types\\n    should reflect to an UPPERCASE type.\\n\\n    b. If the dialect contains a matching dialect-specific type that takes extra arguments \\n    which the generic one does not, then point to the dialect-specific type.  E.g.\\n    mssql.VARCHAR takes a \"collation\" parameter which should be preserved.\\n\\n5. DDL, or what was formerly issued by \"get_col_spec()\", is now handled exclusively by\\na subclass of compiler.GenericTypeCompiler.\\n\\n    a. your TypeCompiler class will receive generic and uppercase types from \\n    sqlalchemy.types.  Do not assume the presence of dialect-specific attributes on\\n    these types. \\n\\n    b. the visit_UPPERCASE methods on GenericTypeCompiler should *not* be overridden with\\n    methods that produce a different DDL name.   Uppercase types don\\'t do any kind of \\n    \"guessing\" - if visit_TIMESTAMP is called, the DDL should render as TIMESTAMP in\\n    all cases, regardless of whether or not that type is legal on the backend database.\\n\\n    c. the visit_UPPERCASE methods *should* be overridden with methods that add additional\\n    arguments and flags to those types.\\n\\n    d. the visit_lowercase methods are overridden to provide an interpretation of a generic \\n    type.  E.g.  visit_large_binary() might be overridden to say \"return self.visit_BIT(type_)\".\\n\\n    e. visit_lowercase methods should *never* render strings directly - it should always\\n    be via calling a visit_UPPERCASE() method.\\n', metadata={'source': 'venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/dialects/type_migration_guidelines.txt'}),\n",

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT\\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\\n1. DEFINITIONS\\n\"Contribution\" means:\\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\\ni) changes to the Program, and\\nii) additions to the Program;\\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution \\'originates\\' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor\\'s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient\\'s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\\n3. REQUIREMENTS\\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\\nb) its license agreement:\\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\\'s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\\n5. NO WARRANTY\\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\\n7. GENERAL\\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient\\'s patent(s), then such Recipient\\'s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\\nAll Recipient\\'s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient\\'s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient\\'s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.

Distribution of Executable Form\\n\\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\\n\\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\\n\\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\\n    the recipients\\' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\\n\\n3.3.

All code authors, and representatives of the companies\\nthey work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the\\npublic domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe\\nat the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,\\ncompile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code\\nform or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,\\nand by any means.\\n\\nThe previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in\\nSQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship\\nwith a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for\\nexample the \"configure\" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other\\nopen-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final\\ndeliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those\\nscripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the\\nSQLite library.\\n\\nAll of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code\\nhas been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of\\ncode can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have\\npublic domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is\\nuncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.\\n\\n_____\\n\\ngoogle/XNNPACK\\n\\nBSD License\\n\\nFor XNNPACK software\\n\\nCopyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\\n\\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\\n\\n0. Definitions.\\n\\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\\non the Runtime Library.\\n\\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\\n\\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\\nthe license of GCC.\\n\\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\\n\\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\\npreprocessors.\\n\\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\\nEligible Compilation Process.\\n\\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\\n\\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\\n\\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\\n\\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\\n\\n----\\n\\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\\n\\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\\n\\n                            Preamble\\n\\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\\n\\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\nyour programs, too.\\n\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\n\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\n\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\\nknow their rights.\\n\\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\\n\\n  For the developers\\' and authors\\' protection, the GPL clearly explains\\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\\' and\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\nauthors of previous versions.\\n\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\n\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n  0. Definitions.\\n\\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\\n\\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\\n\\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\\n\\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\\n\\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\\non the Program.\\n\\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\\n\\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\\n\\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\\n\\n  1. Source Code.\\n\\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\\nform of a work.\\n\\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\\n\\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\\n\\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work\\'s\\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\\n\\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\\nSource.\\n\\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\\nsame work.\\n\\n  2. Basic Permissions.\\n\\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\\n\\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\\n\\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\\nmakes it unnecessary.\\n\\n  3. Protecting Users\\' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\\n\\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\\nmeasures.\\n\\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\\'s\\nusers, your or third parties\\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\\ntechnological measures.\\n\\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\\n\\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\\'s source code as you\\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\\n\\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\\n\\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\\n\\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\\n\\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\\n\\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\\n\\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\\n    work need not make them do so.\\n\\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\\'s users\\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\\nparts of the aggregate.\\n\\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\\n\\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\\nin one of these ways:\\n\\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\\n    customarily used for software interchange.\\n\\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\\n\\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\\n    with subsection 6b.\\n\\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\\n\\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\\n    charge under subsection 6d.\\n\\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\\n\\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\\n\\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\\nmodification has been made.\\n\\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\\nbeen installed in ROM).\\n\\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\\nprotocols for communication across the network.\\n\\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\\nunpacking, reading or copying.\\n\\n  7. Additional Terms.\\n\\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\\n\\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\\n\\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\\n\\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\\n\\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\\n\\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\\n\\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\\n    authors of the material; or\\n\\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\\n\\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\\n    those licensors and authors.\\n\\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\\n\\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\\n\\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\\nthe above requirements apply either way.\\n\\n  8. Termination.\\n\\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\\nparagraph of section 11).\\n\\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\\n\\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\\nyour receipt of the notice.\\n\\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\\nmaterial under section 10.\\n\\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\\n\\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\\n\\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\\n\\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\\n\\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\\nlicenses to the work the party\\'s predecessor in interest had or could\\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\\n\\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\\n\\n  11. Patents.\\n\\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor\\'s \"contributor version\".\\n\\n  A contributor\\'s \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\\nthis License.\\n\\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\\npatent license under the contributor\\'s essential patent claims, to\\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\\n\\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\\npatent against the party.\\n\\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient\\'s use of the covered work\\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\\n\\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\\nwork and works based on it.\\n\\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\\n\\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\\n\\n  12. No Surrender of Others\\' Freedom.\\n\\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\\n\\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\\n\\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\\ncombination as such.\\n\\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\\n\\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\\naddress new problems or concerns.\\n\\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\\nby the Free Software Foundation.\\n\\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\\'s\\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\\nto choose that version for the Program.\\n\\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\\nlater version.\\n\\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\\n\\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\\n\\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\\nSUCH DAMAGES.\\n\\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\\n\\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\\n\\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\\n\\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\\n\\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\\n\\n    <one line to give the program\\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.>\\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\\n\\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\\n    (at your option) any later version.\\n\\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\\n\\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\\n\\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\\n\\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\\n\\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w\\'.\\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\\n    under certain conditions; type `show c\\' for details.\\n\\nThe hypothetical commands `show w\\' and `show c\\' should show the appropriate\\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program\\'s commands\\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\\n\\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\\n\\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\\nPublic License instead of this License.

       " Document(page_content='This folder is a subpackage of ttLib. Each module here is a \\nspecialized TT/OT table converter: they can convert raw data \\nto Python objects and vice versa. Usually you don\\'t need to \\nuse the modules directly: they are imported and used \\nautomatically when needed by ttLib.\\n\\nIf you are writing you own table converter the following is \\nimportant.\\n\\nThe modules here have pretty strange names: this is due to the \\nfact that we need to map TT table tags (which are case sensitive) \\nto filenames (which on Mac and Win aren\\'t case sensitive) as well \\nas to Python identifiers. The latter means it can only contain \\n[A-Za-z0-9_] and cannot start with a number. \\n\\nttLib provides functions to expand a tag into the format used here:\\n\\n>>> from fontTools import ttLib\\n>>> ttLib.tagToIdentifier(\"FOO \")\\n\\'F_O_O_\\'\\n>>> ttLib.tagToIdentifier(\"cvt \")\\n\\'_c_v_t\\'\\n>>> ttLib.tagToIdentifier(\"OS/2\")\\n\\'O_S_2f_2\\'\\n>>> ttLib.tagToIdentifier(\"glyf\")\\n\\'_g_l_y_f\\'\\n>>> \\n\\nAnd vice versa:\\n\\n>>> ttLib.identifierToTag(\"F_O_O_\")\\n\\'FOO \\'\\n>>> ttLib.identifierToTag(\"_c_v_t\")\\n\\'cvt \\'\\n>>> ttLib.identifierToTag(\"O_S_2f_2\")\\n\\'OS/2\\'\\n>>> ttLib.identifierToTag(\"_g_l_y_f\")\\n\\'glyf\\'\\n>>> \\n\\nEg. the \\'glyf\\' table converter lives in a Python file called:\\n\\n\\t_g_l_y_f.py\\n\\nThe converter itself is a class, named \"table_\" + expandedtag. Eg:\\n\\n\\tclass table__g_l_y_f:\\n\\t\\tetc.\\n\\nNote that if you _do_ need to use such modules or classes manually, \\nthere are two convenient API functions that let you find them by tag:\\n\\n>>> ttLib.getTableModule(\\'glyf\\')\\n<module \\'ttLib.tables._g_l_y_f\\'>\\n>>> ttLib.getTableClass(\\'glyf\\')\\n<class ttLib.tables._g_l_y_f.table__g_l_y_f at 645f400>\\n>>> \\n\\nYou must subclass from DefaultTable.DefaultTable. It provides some default\\nbehavior, as well as a constructor method (__init__) that you don\\'t need to \\noverride.\\n\\nYour converter should minimally provide two methods:\\n\\nclass table_F_O_O_(DefaultTable.DefaultTable): # converter for table \\'FOO \\'\\n\\t\\n\\tdef decompile(self, data, ttFont):\\n\\t\\t# \\'data\\' is the raw table data. Unpack it into a\\n\\t\\t# Python data structure.\\n\\t\\t# \\'ttFont\\' is a ttLib.TTfile instance, enabling you to\\n\\t\\t# refer to other tables. Do ***not*** keep a reference to\\n\\t\\t# it: it will cause a circular reference (ttFont saves \\n\\t\\t# a reference to us), and that means we\\'ll be leaking \\n\\t\\t# memory. If you need to use it in other methods, just \\n\\t\\t# pass it around as a method argument.\\n\\t\\n\\tdef compile(self, ttFont):\\n\\t\\t# Return the raw data, as converted from the Python\\n\\t\\t# data structure. \\n\\t\\t# Again, \\'ttFont\\' is there so you can access other tables.\\n\\t\\t# Same warning applies.\\n\\nIf you want to support TTX import/export as well, you need to provide two\\nadditional methods:\\n\\n\\tdef toXML(self, writer, ttFont):\\n\\t\\t# XXX\\n\\t\\n\\tdef fromXML(self, (name, attrs, content), ttFont):\\n\\t\\t# XXX\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/fontTools/ttLib/tables/table_API_readme.txt'}),\n",

See the\\n  GNU General Public License for more details.\\n\\n  Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional\\n  permissions described in the GCC Runtime Library Exception, version\\n  3.1, as published by the Free Software Foundation.\\n\\n  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License and\\n  a copy of the GCC Runtime Library Exception along with this program;\\n  see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME respectively.  If not, see\\n  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\\n\\n----\\n\\nFull text of license texts referred to above follows (that they are\\nlisted below does not necessarily imply the conditions apply to the\\npresent binary release):\\n\\n----\\n\\nGCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\\n\\nVersion 3.1, 31 March 2009\\n\\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\\n\\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\\n\\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional\\npermission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\\n3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\\n\\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\\n\\n0. Definitions.\\n\\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\\non the Runtime Library.\\n\\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\\n\\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\\nthe license of GCC.\\n\\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\\n\\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\\npreprocessors.\\n\\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\\nEligible Compilation Process.\\n\\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\\n\\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\\n\\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\\n\\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\\n\\n----\\n\\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\\n\\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\\n\\n                            Preamble\\n\\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\\n\\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\nyour programs, too.\\n\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\n\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\n\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\\nknow their rights.\\n\\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\\n\\n  For the developers\\' and authors\\' protection, the GPL clearly explains\\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\\' and\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\nauthors of previous versions.\\n\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\n\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n  0. Definitions.\\n\\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\\n\\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\\n\\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\\n\\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\\n\\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\\non the Program.\\n\\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\\n\\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\\n\\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\\n\\n  1. Source Code.\\n\\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\\nform of a work.\\n\\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\\n\\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\\n\\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work\\'s\\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\\n\\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\\nSource.\\n\\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\\nsame work.\\n\\n  2. Basic Permissions.\\n\\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\\n\\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\\n\\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\\nmakes it unnecessary.\\n\\n  3. Protecting Users\\' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\\n\\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\\nmeasures.\\n\\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\\'s\\nusers, your or third parties\\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\\ntechnological measures.\\n\\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\\n\\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\\'s source code as you\\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\\n\\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\\n\\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\\n\\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\\n\\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\\n\\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\\n\\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\\n    work need not make them do so.\\n\\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\\'s users\\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\\nparts of the aggregate.\\n\\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\\n\\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\\nin one of these ways:\\n\\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\\n    customarily used for software interchange.\\n\\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\\n\\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\\n    with subsection 6b.\\n\\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\\n\\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\\n    charge under subsection 6d.\\n\\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\\n\\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\\n\\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\\nmodification has been made.\\n\\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\\nbeen installed in ROM).\\n\\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\\nprotocols for communication across the network.\\n\\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\\nunpacking, reading or copying.\\n\\n  7. Additional Terms.\\n\\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\\n\\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\\n\\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\\n\\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\\n\\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\\n\\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\\n\\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\\n    authors of the material; or\\n\\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\\n\\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\\n    those licensors and authors.\\n\\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\\n\\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\\n\\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\\nthe above requirements apply either way.\\n\\n  8. Termination.\\n\\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\\nparagraph of section 11).\\n\\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\\n\\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\\nyour receipt of the notice.\\n\\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\\nmaterial under section 10.\\n\\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\\n\\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\\n\\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\\n\\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\\n\\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\\nlicenses to the work the party\\'s predecessor in interest had or could\\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\\n\\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\\n\\n  11. Patents.\\n\\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor\\'s \"contributor version\".\\n\\n  A contributor\\'s \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\\nthis License.\\n\\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\\npatent license under the contributor\\'s essential patent claims, to\\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\\n\\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\\npatent against the party.\\n\\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient\\'s use of the covered work\\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\\n\\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\\nwork and works based on it.\\n\\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\\n\\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\\n\\n  12. No Surrender of Others\\' Freedom.\\n\\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\\n\\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\\n\\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\\ncombination as such.\\n\\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\\n\\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\\naddress new problems or concerns.\\n\\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\\nby the Free Software Foundation.\\n\\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\\'s\\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\\nto choose that version for the Program.\\n\\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\\nlater version.\\n\\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\\n\\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\\n\\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\\nSUCH DAMAGES.\\n\\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\\n\\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\\n\\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\\n\\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\\n\\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\\n\\n    <one line to give the program\\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.>\\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\\n\\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\\n    (at your option) any later version.\\n\\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\\n\\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\\n\\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\\n\\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\\n\\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w\\'.\\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\\n    under certain conditions; type `show c\\' for details.\\n\\nThe hypothetical commands `show w\\' and `show c\\' should show the appropriate\\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program\\'s commands\\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\\n\\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\\n\\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\\ninto proprietary programs.
